20100101,20100101," Albuquerque, NM", light,Half an hour,My wife and I were outside in the Jacuzzi when she first saw a light.  It glowed and traveled from north to south.  It lit up again when I then saw it and then dimmed and traveled further south and then disappeared.   About twenty minutes latter as I looked toward the upward northwest sky I saw another light glow and travel at the same time.  It dimmed and kept moving west to east.  It lit again and traveled some more and then disappeared.  I have seen something similar and wonder what it is.  My wife saw a flying wing last year and we see other lights on occasion.  Ufo&rsquo;s maybe I don&rsquo;t know.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD)),

There was only one of them.  I noticed it because it had three very bright white lights on a triangular shaped object about the size of 3-4 king size beds (sorry that I can&apos;t be any more accurate).  It had a red light in the middle which went brighter and dimmmer.  I only seen it for up to 10seconds, I have limited view outside my bedroom window and it went pretty fast.  It didn&apos;t make any noise though.  I think the colour must have been black, or something very dark, its dark outside so i would have noticed it if was very colourful.Hmm, about me: I&apos;m 19 yrs old, a makeup artist/model from Nottigham, England. That should be sufficient",

20100101,20100101," Richmond, VA", triangle,1.5 minutes,"Possible triangle craft spotted in Richmond VAI am 14 years old, and I also hold a 2nd Degree Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do. On the way home from T.K.D. lessons, we had stopped in a traffic jam next to a high school football field. I peered out the window to get a better look at the traffic, and in the sky I saw 4 lights in a triangular formation; 3 white lights in each corner of the triangle and a single red light in the center.It was dark, and all I could tell from the lights were that they did not flash or blink in any way. I know that there were some power lines around, but if there was a solid object behind those lights, it was enormous. I&apos;m sure others saw it, but I can&apos;t be sure. The craft did move, at a speed I estimate to be about 5 mph. I know that this was not the illusion created from the moving car, as I saw it move even when we were stopped. I didn&apos;t bother to tell my mom and sister, as they would just think I was joking.I&apos;ve heard of the theorized TR-3B &quot;Government UFO,&quot; and I think that what I saw might bear a resemblance to the infamous Black Triangle.The lights were still there, even after the traffic started to pick up again.The next day, we took the same route to and from Tae Kwon Do lessons. On the way to our lesson, I looked at the spot in the sky where I had spotted the 3 lights. There was nothing like a cellphone, VOR or radio tower in the vicinity. On the way home, I looked in the sky and the lights weren&apos;t there.This still remains a mystery to me, and I&apos;m still investigating this incident.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

It also seemed to respond to a led light i hadmyself and a friend were on our way back to my house around 2 in the morning when the car we were in got a flat tire. From the spot of the car to the sighting is around 4 miles and we were walking. We have been walking for a little over a hour or so and decided to stop for a little bit to have a cigarette and look over a bridge. After standing for a while about 5-10 minutes looking over the right side of the bridge we decided to start walking home again, when we turned to keep going I looked over the tree line to our left and there was a strange looking light, almost like a star but slightly bigger and not one solid color. As we stood and observed this object it seemed to change colors, from red to purple to blue, and so on. It seemed to be getting closer and then started moving side to side and up and down. I took a chance and grabed a white led light i have on my keychain and flashed it at the object. When i did so it seemed to move more and the lights wer! e still changing. It moved up higher to the left, back down and then went right at the speed it was moving at then like a flash dissapeared to the right. We stood in the road and decided to get out of there and as we came off the bridge i got an erie feeling and before i could say anything my friend said he saw something in the road. I thought i saw something too but it was so dark i coulden&apos;t tell. We had stopped in our tracks from the first time we decided to stop for about a half an hour now and not one car or truck had gone passed us. We couldent turn around or go any other direction so we started to run towards what we thought we saw in the road. Either we scarred it or there was nothing in the road so we continued on our way home. The next day on our way to my house in my car this time there seemed to be the same light changing object over the lake now. When we got to my house it was still visible but by the time we got outside with a camera it was gone. At the north ! end of the lake there is an airforce base, and there is a nava! l statio n on the lake. Anything that has come from the airforce base is very loud, not as fast,and could never hover or move like the object we saw that night.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the source does not indicate that fact.

20100101,20100101," La Mesa, CA", triangle,4-6 minutes,"3 bright red lights hovering high in the sky in an elongated triangle pattern just after midnight 2010 in La Mesa, CaTonight at appx 12:10am there were 3 bright red lights in the sky in a stretched out triangular formation directly overhead on my patio in La Mesa.  Compared to a clock they were at appx 11:00 and 1:00 with the elongated triangle ending at 6:00. My home is in Mount Helix, Ca about 1/2 mile up Fuerte Drive from the I-8 Freeway heading east, my home is on the north side of Fuerte Dr and I was on my patio facing south. These lights were directly overhead as was the moon, they were just east of the moon, my husband and I both saw these and he and I both wondered if someone launched a very high balloon in the sky but they just sat there and hovered, I have never seen anything like this in my life, I&rsquo;m 55. The entire triangle formation would be covered in length by holding appx 3 fists towards the sky from the two lights above to the one below, the two lights above were appx 1 fist apart from what I recall. They were much bigger than the surrounding stars like the ! size of an airplane light though they didn&rsquo;t move and hovered directly over my home in this elongated triangle pattern for many minutes, maybe 4-6 from the time we both saw them. I went inside and came back out and saw they had moved toward the west and were still very bright, I went inside to find my camera and when I came back outside they were gone, no trace of them anywhere. It is crystal clear in the sky tonight and I have a great view, they were not completely round, maybe just slightly elongated circles of lights. There was also no audible sound like a plane engine, whatever this was it just hovered for many minutes without making any sound. I don&apos;t know if this was 3 separate things or one object with lights in a triangle shape.",
20100101,20100101," Mount Helix Park, CA", circle,20 minutes,"3 Red Beacons in Triangular Shape above Mount Helix at Midnight of NYE 2010.My friend and I walked up to the peak of Mount Helix in Spring Valley, San Diego around 11:30pm on 12/31/09 to celebrate the New Year with short meditations and a wonderful view of the city.  We gathered together in front of the large cross right before midnight and both said some kind of prayer and set intentions for ourselves, others and the world for this next year.  We gathered together all of our negative energy and offered it up with appreciation for all the wisdom we gained from its challenges.  As soon as we offered them up towards the sky, we instantly noticed 3 Bright Circular Red Beacons in a triangular shape in the sky slightly north of our position on the hill.  They were just floating without any sound whatsoever and the light remained constant.  My friend said he noticed some flickering of another color (possibly green and red) as he zoomed in with his digital camera but I did not notice this nor was this apparent to the naked eye.  We thought! they might be helicopters at first but they seemed way too high, stationary, mute and close together to be so.  After a couple minutes or so, they began to slowly float directly above our location and then slightly past.  Their triangular shape began to grow smaller as the Beacons moved closer to each other.  Then, at approx. 12:15am, one Beacon began to move off in the distance towards Downtown SD and the waterfront.  The light eventually disappeared in the distance - again, no sound, no other blinking lights and very high up in the sky (nothing like a helicopter).  The other remained for about 2-3 more minutes.  Then they both began to fade as they seemed to travel farther and farther away from the surface of the earth.  By this time, the lights were in between the constellation Orion and the Blue Moon.  The lights, according to our best observations, did not simply dim and shut off but actually &quot;flew&quot; or floated farther and farther away from Earth until they finally dis! appeared from our view amongst the stars.  We did not see any addition al sightings afterwards.  We have short video clips from a Digital Camera of the lights throughout various times while they were present. I am not sure what they were, but they were not frightening at all.  We both felt it was somewhat of a sign or response to our prayers for guidance that we started the night off with. I am a 25 year old Graduate Student who lives in North East CT but was born and raised here, in Southern California.  My friend is 41 and is an Opera Singer and a Substitute teacher pursuing his teaching credential.  We are both certified Yoga instructors and are very open to new thought and spiritual beliefs as well as appreciating the beauties of existing religions.",

I stepped outside and looking east towards the mountains three red lights shaped into a triangle are visible.  At first i thought they were flares or fireworks but the lights were stationary.  And the three lights remain still for 10 minutes then slowly began to rise for 5-8 minutes and one after another they began to disappear into the night.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

20100101,20100101," Butler, MO", cylinder,4 hours,"sightind and abduction on country road.We were going out to photograph, at night, blindly shooting down into gulleys  and streams, hollows and deep inside walled areas of trees.  Our hope was too catch animals off guard and maybe get interesting pictures. I was using a flash, on each and shot over a hundred pictures that night.We left at 8,30   Throughout  the entire evening,  we felt only that a calming ride in the country had occurred with possibly some good pictures . Pictures we&apos;d view in the morning  on the computer. The next morning when I looked through them enlarging them on  photo gallery, I saw the two pictures and a few others.  I&apos;m sending. 4 that night that I had no memory,, of taking.We had no memory at all of anything seen in the images, the craft, or the thing in front of the car.    No memory of being stopped.    We returned on the next night thinking something cool had happened seeing a UFO and  thought since we were unharmed it would be safe to return. The next night we went we had similar results, a few more pictures that were strange even more frightening because of the activity in front of our car that could not be made out clearly.We were  slightly worried but more curious about the ship we had seen twice in the pictures. and after a few more days thought again it might be safe, so we returned with tape recorders in the car.And the things on the tapes were muffled but a few areas crystal clear,  one of these was our talking on the tape, and then the car stopping suddenly, the doors came open and my wife was drug out with a whimper, and the sound of me struggling in my seat unable to speak went on for some time, possibly 10 seconds, there was a humming sound in two short bursts, and I was heard struggling no longer, in fact neither of us  were heard.There is a point where a voice makes a sexual reference, one sentence,,  and then that yea their dumb.  Afterward, some time later( yea there almost ready. )  the sounds of  arranging equipment? Like picking up stuff , closing a container, etc. Within the next minute we start the car, pull away driving again, and resume the conversation we had been having before the incident.We returned home, ready for sleep, having no idea anything had occurred.  We had by mid-night the beginning of severe abdominal pain and rectal pain as well, identical. These conditions lasted for the better part of three days.  This and the things found on the tape made it clear what  had possibly  taken place .Again photos were in the large set ,of only a odd shaped vehicle outside the car stirring up dust.  Its strange sound on the tape.  There were other things said so disturbing to us, I destroyed the tapes.  The photos I&apos;m sending are the clearest free of dust flakes that made the others unidentifiable.  We experienced a time loss of roughly an hour two times at least.During a recent  hospital trip a small round polished bead the size of a BB, the airgun ammo, was seen in my sinus cavity in a  x-ray.  Also, I have a hole on the back of my neck, near my hairline, that a  sewing needle could be inserted almost its whole length, eye first with no pain.  No blood or discharge of any kind.  It can still be seen.",
20100101,20100101," Borger, TX", other,1 minute,"300-400 foot boomerang-shaped object moving at 200 mph?, one-half mile distant at about 2,000 ft altitude.  Clear skies, daytime.This sighting occurred in June 1983 in Borger, Texas.  I had not reported this earlier because at the time it occurred I had no corroborating witnesses, no photographs, essentially nothing to substantiate the claim.  I doubted that anyone would have believed what I saw at the time.  However, this sighting stays in the back of my mind, so I am reporting it, if for no other reason, than to have closure.The sighting occurred about 17:30 (Local Time, Central Time Zone) in June 1983.  I was in my residence and heard what I thought was a really, really, loud jet.  It was so loud that I stepped out on my front porch to see what it was.  I looked up and the object was probably one-half mile away at an altitude of probably two thousand feet.  (These are only estimations.)   It was huge.I had a pair of 10 X 35 binoculars in the living room, so I quickly stepped back inside and grabbed the binoculars.  By that time the object was receding, so I might have been better off not using the binoculars.  I remember the object filled the binocular&rsquo;s field of view, which at the time made me wonder just how big this thing actually was.What I saw was a large black boomerang-shaped object, moving from east to west.  It was travelling at a modest speed, maybe 200 miles per hour (again, it&rsquo;s hard to estimate something in the sky without reference points.)  I remember as I looked at the object, there were three specific things that struck me.  The first was the size&hellip;I can only guess that it was 300-400 feet side-to-side and maybe 75-125 feet front-to-back.  The second was the tremendous noise the object made.  It was LOUD.  And, third, the fact that the object was lopsided; that is to say it was asymmetrical.  I wondered how it stayed in the air&hellip;it didn&rsquo;t look aerodynamic.I think another reason I never reported this is the fact that it sounded like a really large jet.  Maybe it was&hellip;if so, it was like nothing I had seen before and have not seen since.  The jet sound made me think it was a conventional aircraft, but the shape and the size made me think it was something beyond classification. I did not notice any exhaust or smoke behind the craft.Since then I have seen video of the A1 bomber and other stealth aircraft.  On one occasion I saw an A1 pass directly overhead.  Believe me, the thing I saw in 1983 makes the A1 look like a toy.By definition, what I saw was a UFO, because it was not identified, it was flying and it was an object.  Whether it was of terrestrial origin or somewhere else, I don&rsquo;t know  I wish I did.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",

Also, the lights hovered in the same location for the entire 15 minutes we watched.

We looked towards the north to see what they were examining.  We pulled to the side of the road exited the vehicle and looked towards the direction the other family was. We thought at first the activity was fireworks but until all commotion stop 2 orangey-red lights were continuing to hover above the town. We followed the lights as they did acrobatic movements unlike any United States military aircraft. We continued to a back road heading south toward my house when in the rear view mirror we spotted another to objects behind us. We again exited the vehicle to observe the lights.  They slowly headed our direction from the northwest to the s! outh. The seemed to be circling each other, again doing acrobatic moves a normal aircraft is unable to perform. We continued to observe when one of the objects we lost behind a cloud in the northwest.  The other aircraft shot straight into the shy were we could no longer see it.

I did not see a cockpit, wings or tail. (I admit I was pretty astonished and didn&rsquo;t look as carefully as I would if I saw something like that again.) It was not like any aircraft I&apos;ve seen nor did look like the pictures of the triangular stealth jet.  It was possibly the length of a large jet (747)and seemed to be about as wide as the freeway lanes.  The flashing red light was in the middle of the bottom of the craft. There were bright white lights across the end and what appeared to be lighted windows along the side.The traffic light changed almost immediately and I drove under the freeway, looking up and observing the bottom of the craft. It seemed to be on a slight descent and the bottom seemed completely flat with just the red light in the middle.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",

I was sitting in the window seat of the aircraft, as I enjoy air-travel and watching our take-off&apos;s.  Heathrow airport was busy at the time, and I was watching many other planes around us out of the window.  We had reached about 1000 feet when I saw a dot about 500 feet below us, at a perpendicular angle towards the plane.  I followed the object, looking intently, expecting to be able to identify the aircraft as it approached closer.  As it approached I was very surprised to see that it did not materialize into any sort of aviation related object.  It was a perfectly spherical shape, a light yet dull metallic gray in colour, with no visible markings or imperfections in the purely circular shape. It caught my attention, and I struggled to figure out what it was.  I assumed it must have been a stationary object on the ground until it passed approximately 500 feet below the ! plane at a relatively high velocity.  From my guess it was relatively small object, no more than 5 metres in diameter.  I was completely and utterly puzzled, having never seen anything like it.  I have excellent 20/20 vision, and it was a perfect day visually, no clouds/precipitation or fog, and the sun was not too bright.  I was quite alert at the time, and was not tired.I made out the object very clearly, and could easily define the spherical shape and dull metallic colour, it was not blurry in any way and definitely was not a speck or smudge on the aircraft window.  That bizarre sighting has puzzled me ever since.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",

I noticed out the passenger window two red lights hovering in the sky. It was hovering in the air, much too low for any aircraft that I would normally see. It was dark, and cloudy, but the moon still kept in light enough to see. I watched it for a few more seconds, confused as to what I was really seeing. I pointed in the sky, and asked my friends if they saw taht was well. As we kept driving, we could see it from underneath and to the side. The UFO was a wide triangular shape, with two red lights that sort of blinked at each end on the back. At the front tip was another light, and underneath there seemed to be another light closer to the front. The craft was dark, and thick. It was close enough that I could see the wings were the thick side angles. The craft was sleek, like a jet, but wider then anything I have seen. We all grabbed our cameras and pulled the car over. As we did t! hough, the craft (still hovering in the same spot) begin to rise. We got out of the car and the craft was higher in the sky. Then, it turned to the right while staying in the same spot, about 90 degrees, and begin flying away. It moved away from us fast, and was too far to take a picture. Within mintues we had seen this craft hovering above the city, then turn to face the right in the same position, and leave. No military type craft can hover in one spot and then turn on a dime like that. Another strange thing was that there was no noise that came from the craft, it was silent.",

It appeared in luminosity similar to a star or satellite.  In addition, it appeared to be of very high altitude, again similar to a satellite.  This was apparent as the jet plane was passing from East to West at a high altitude at the same time I noted the unknown light.  The plane was crossing the sky at an approximate 50 degree relative elevation from my vantage point, and the unknown light was at an approximate 70 degree relative elevation when first sighted.My initial thought was this was a satellite, as I have seen these many times at night and on occasion during the day.  However, this light did not behave as other satellites I have observed.  The light moved relatively slow in comparison.  The light took approximately 30 seconds to move directly overhead.  It then stopped for approximately 3 to 5 seconds.   The light very slightly grew in size and brightness during this period of first sight to the stop over head.  I also had called my wife out to see it during this period.   She also observed the light.  I asked to bring the camcorder to see if we could get the light on video.The light then moved in westerly direction.  Again, slower than a plane or satellite.  We tried to film the light with two camcorders but are unsure if we captured it (we have not reviewed the tapes as of this reporting).  The light continued on its westerly course for approximately 3 minutes before I noted it was moving slightly to the west/south/west (say 15 degrees from true west).  The light was approximately at 75 to 80 degrees relative elevation.  Please note I can assure the light was very distant as it was obscured for a second or two by part of high cloud.I continued to intermittently observe the light for another minute.

At about 2:00 AM GMT, I was awake on the transatlantic flight at the time the cabin lights were dimmed and many people were sleeping and there was very little to no activity going on. I looked out the window at the stars, and noticed three bright red lights overhead in the one- to two-o&apos;clock position in the sky. Thinking this was a reflection of cabin lights, I cupped my hands over my eyes to block out any reflecting light. The lights were bright and clear overhead, so I then immediately thought these were outside lights. I looked down over the wing lights, and noticed that the right wing light was white; since I couldn&apos;t see the tail at all from the window, I realized these were not tail lights. In addition, they were overhead, where I had to actually look up from the window,! so I realized these lights were neither part of the plane nor were they land lights, since this was over the ocean.As this was also in the middle of the non-eventful flight, the cruising altitude had not changed, so the three red lights in triangular form must have been at the very least, 60,000 - 80,000 ft. high. The lights also had a blinking pattern which uniformly looped over and over for the ten-minute sighting: the two left side lights blinked once, followed by the top right light; then the two top lights blinked once, followed by the bottom left light; then all three lights together blinked in unison. This pattern of blinking was happening during the entire time.In addition, unlike seeing another plane in flight, these red lights were stationary - with the Delta airplane moving away. It was like seeing bright blinking lights on the ground - but in reverse. The blinking lights were above and we were flying below, moving more and more out of view. After about ten minutes, the stationary blinking lights were moving out of view as the plane moved further to the &quot;left,&quot; or east. After they were out of view, the view out the window looking in same direction was pitch black; it was then, when I realized this was clearly not a reflection but an actual set of lights in a triangular form, blinking in patterns and &apos;hovering&apos; over the North Atlantic Ocean.",

I would have totally brushed it off as an aircraft, as we genearlly have lots of those in the Orlando Area but they didnt seem to move.  The lights were also very close to the ground, and usually landing lights on a jet liner will hit part of the fuselage, and nothing like that was visable.  Ususally large aircraft are not close to the ground at this point, as they are also close to Disney World.. and I think the FAA doesn&apos;t allow large comercial traffic to be low flying above a theme park.  I&apos;m not sure what I was seeing.  There are not any radio towers here, I didnt see anything that looked like a blimp (bowl games.. etc) and there were way too many lights, and too far apart for it to be a helicopter.

It was a beautifully clear night.  I noticed lights over the I-5 freeway that seemed to be too low in the sky to be a plane and they didn&apos;t appear to be a helicopter.  As we approached the object appeared to be hovering.  I pointed it out to my friend who was driving and said, &quot;What the hell is that!&quot;   At that time we were approaching a stop light on the corner of 3rd and Capital Mall and it was clear the object was moving but very slow.  At that point with all the lights from the freeway and building etc, all we could make out were the lights on the object which I think were red and white.  As we turned left heading South on 3rd Street, the object passed overhead slightly to the rear of the truck and we both clearly saw the triangle shape.  It headed West across the Sacramento River tow! ard the Port of Sacramento which is located in West Sacramento.  We both saw the triangle shape clearly as it passed overhead and we could see a white light in the center of the triangle.  Once it went over the river it tilted to the right and headed in a Northerly direction.  There were no news reports of any kind the next day.

They are outside our atmosphere and appear as something similar in size to stars (as we view stars from Earth) but they move in every given direction. I&rsquo;ve observed them stop and then start moving again, make 90 degree turns, suddenly increase speed until they appear almost a streak, stop just as suddenly, etc.  I&rsquo;ve seen as many as 9 of them at one time (about 2 years ago), with all 9 of them going in different directions and patterns and &ldquo;performing&rdquo; in a manner that I would liken to an air show.  I&rsquo;m so curious about them that I watch for them any time I go outside at night, just in case they might be there.On December 30, 2009, at about 6:30pm I was outside smoking when I saw two of them toward the south-southwest and moving in a northerly direction.  About the time I saw them, my husband joined me on the porch and I pointed them out to him.  (I would note that my husband was in law enforcement for several years and is skeptical of nearly everything.)  As we were watching them, one of the &ldquo;dots&rdquo; split off into two &ldquo;dots.&rdquo;  I had never seen them do that before and it certainly got my husband&rsquo;s attention.  At almost the same time, a 3rd and 4th one appeared in a different area of the sky (slightly more westerly and also moving north).  We noticed them at the same time.  The 3rd one then turned hard toward the east and immediately became incredibly bright &ndash; something else I&rsquo;ve never observed one of them do.  It appeared to be banking in a turn and it grew even brighter as it banked and also seemed to elongate.  It quickly gained speed as it went east; turned a soft red color and ! then faded out of sight.  My husband asked if I had seen it get longer and I told him that I definitely noticed that.Tonight (1.04.10) at about 7 p.m., I went out onto the porch and saw one of the &ldquo;star dots&rdquo; very far away and moving very slowly.  I was surprised as I usually don&rsquo;t see them that close together, with the previous sighting being just 5 days ago.  As I watched it, I caught a bright light out of the corner of my eye.  I called out to my husband &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one of them flying VERY LOW this time!&rdquo;  It appeared, of course, to be much larger than they usually appear because it was so low &ndash; somewhat lower than a commercial airliner would fly - but the light of it was too bright to allow us to make out its shape.  It was not flying in a perfectly straight line; it wavered slightly from time to time.  As we watched the low, bright one I remarked to my husband that it seemed to be tracking the smaller, more distant one move for move.  He agreed that that&rsquo;s what it looked like it was doing.

The light didn&apos;t emit any type of trail.  The light was a very bright and was blinking the whole time.

20100107,20100107," El Cajon, CA", light,Noticed from dusk to dawn,"&quot;Fake stars&quot; over San Diego, CAAt turn of the new year, I stepped outside a moment before it turned midnight and noticed three red lights hovering. I would like to point out these are not the lights I&apos;m referring to as these have been dismissed as a hoax.That being said, the red lights caused me to notice the sky more than I had been and my husband and I noticed at least a couple dozen stars that flicker, rather than twinkle as a star does. These lights can be either a silvery color, or golden, but they all alternately flash red also. The first couple nights, we just gazed in amazement and didn&apos;t notice too many details. But I do know they seemed to move very slowly if you watched them long enough. I don&apos;t mean that my perspective on them changed as Earth rotated; I mean that they steered every so slowly to a different position and then stopped. They also seemed to be clustered in one small area around Orion&apos;s belt mostly, until Orion&apos;s belt moved out of sight. BUT even after Orion moved out of sight these strange fake stars would still be in the same area. They never left the area even after Orion (there are rarely any other stars visible in San Diego at night lately) was way out of sight due to the Earth&apos;s rotation.Nights of 1/3-1/5, I stayed out as often and late as I could given that I have three kids to take care of. I peeked out a couple times per hour, staying up late and watching them til 3 or 4 in the morning. They seemed to light in 1 position and stay there constantly for the most part on these nights, with the occasional one disappearing suddenly or shifting slightly. Colors remain same. I have noticed that there is one set that I call the Non-Rectangle, because if it weren&apos;t for one &quot;star&quot; being up and out a little bit too much, they would form a perfect rectangle. However, they are in a different configuration every night, i.e. the &quot;slightly off star&quot; would be on the bottom and left one night, and on top and right the next. Makes me think it&apos;s a craft that lands in a different spot every night and thinks we won&apos;t notice.1/6 and 1/7, 2010 I have not been able to go outside to watch their behavior, I have just had too many things to do.I got video, in fact about 10 of them with my webcam since I don&apos;t have a regular camera, but strangely, I can&apos;t get them to upload to any of the sites I tried to upload them to. I managed to get 1 pic on my cell phone to show up and I will try to attach it.The oddest thing of all to me, is that no one else is talking about them, everyone is concentrated on the sham red lights of New Year&apos;s Eve that one guy hoaxed. However, my kids and mom see them, and so does my apartment complex manager, so they are truly there.One other strange detail is that on 1/3-1/5, there have been a highly unusual number of small, low-flying normal planes as well as helicopters, making me wonder if they&apos;re &quot;investigating.&quot;  I have not been able to stay awake and outside to witness them make their &quot;disappearance&quot; at dawn so I don&apos;t know what that consists of.They are currently still there, although small in number at this precise moment. I can&apos;t figure out for the life of me why people aren&apos;t interested in them.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",

About 20 minutes after the pilot announced we had reached our cruising altitude of 35,000 feet, I noticed what appeared to be five large rods protruding upward from the clouds off the right wing about 1/4 mile to a 1/2 mile out.  The rods looked like manmade structures, each about 10-20 feet high.  Each rod had the appearance of a cell-phone tower -- metallic weaving.  There were five rods in total, each spaced approximately 80-150 feet apart, forming what looked like a pentagon. No connecting tower or craft was visible.I pointed this out to a younger friend, who at first didn&apos;t notice them.  After a minute or so, he finally located they him.  He said they appeared to be &quot;drifting.&quot;  Again, we were at 35,000 feet, so there&apos;s no way they could have been part of a grounded structure.  They remained visible for about 6-8 minutes before our flight moved away.  They never appeared to move and visibility was very good at our altitude.We checked into weather instrumentation and nothing matches. I&apos;m still not convinced it was a UFO, but certainly strange.",

As we were starting the vehicles, we both caught sight of an object in the air approximately 1 mile away.  We both made reference as to how low the object was, maybe 1-2000 feet in the air.  The trajectory of the object was by no means in the direction of any nearby airports, and was flying in an extremely straight path.  These things in and of themselves are not entirely out of the ordinary.  However, the following statements were mind baffling.The speed of the aircraft was very slow.  Judging from our vantage point, the object appeared to be moving somewhere in the range of 30-50 mph.  To say that the object was &ldquo;probably 2 miles up in the air so it appeared to move slower than it was&rdquo; does not apply here.  If that were the case, then my estimated size of the object would be about 1000 feet wide, as opposed to the large airliner-size that it appeared.  There were 3 lights on the object; one on each of the sides, and one near what would be considered the back.The final piece of information about the object was that it was completely silent.  On a clear, cold night in January, with little or no wind to affect the sound, almost any plane in the air is audible to some extent. Not this particular object.   Normally with an aircraft at 5 times its height a faint engine roar could still be heard; but totally silent.  We watched the object for a couple of minutes as it slowly made its way off into the distance.  It was not until I got home and started looking online did I realize that I very well might have seen a UFO.",

I filmed one near the Moon as the other two rose in the sky. Then the one near the Moon disappeared fading out as I watched. Then I noticed as I watched each faded as I watched them get higher in the sky from over the top of my roof to above my head. But I started to realize by the time the fifth one appeared it had rose from the south but was disappearing more to the west and not directly overhead anymore. To me this meant it may have been moving outside of the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, and the earth was moving below them. Each faded out to the naked eye as they past slowly overhead.

I watched it for about 5 minutes, it was still there when I proceeded to go on to my mothers.She lived about a mile away.She came out and got in the car, we proceeded to go to the store.I backed out and went to the stop sign by her house and there was the object up close now flying very slow over the buildings and trees.The object was very large about the size of a football field, it was mettallic in color, it made no sound, it had no windows or lights, it was between being oval shaped and mushroom shaped.This craft flew so slow it was almost hovering. Now the strangest thing about this! object is coming from the bottom center it had a black tube looking object coming from it about half the size of the craft.Now while I watched this craft I had the strange feeling that it was hunting for something. I watched it until it went out of sight, or as if it blended into the enviroment.I will always remember that day, it will always be very clear in my mind.And then the very next night I went over again to take my mother to the store, we go to the stop sign again, it is around 10;00 pm and there flying at an average speed was many bright white lights flying scattered all over the sky making no sound. When we got home we were watching the news and the castors were talking about the strange lights flying over Andrews Airforce base, and making jokes about them being ufos flying over the base. Now when I saw this craft it was around 11;00 am in the daytime on a gray cloudless day, there were no leaves on the trees,and I saw this craft up close, and I watched it for at! least 10;00minutes. I just want this on record somewhere what! I saw t hat day. I sure will never forget it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",

It looked like an oval in the sky with a purple and a green light.It looked like it was circling in the sky. I could see the outline of the figure. It wasn&rsquo;t very big it looked like the size of a Cessna airplane but round. It moved very fast it lasted about 10 seconds  (I was looking thru my 4 by 3 foot window). I knew it wasn&rsquo;t a reflection from anything. It also was not a light from outside because almost no lights were on, the only lights that were on were from a stop light but those were not the colors of lights I saw.I never saw anything like that before. When I saw it I didn&rsquo;t think of anything but &ldquo;UFO&rdquo;. Thou I don&rsquo;t have any proof such as pictures or videos I know what I saw and nothing can change that.

They are not unusual but I have not seen any flying in formation like this here before. I was on a walk with my girlfriend and we both arrived back at the apt. around 2:00p.m. We were entering the stairwell from the parking lot and I noticed a strange looking large, slow moving object over head. I called it to her attention when we were on the stairs. It was so surreal! No noises, no recognizable shape at first. We both stood in awe and asked each other what it was. It looked as if it were a giant 3 orbed blimp, reddish brown in color. I ran into the apt. and snapped some pictures of it from my balcony. I watched it morph into the familiar classic saucer shape as it flew in a perfectly straight line south to where the helicopters were earlier. It hovered in the exact same spot for about 3 minutes and I took some more pictures of it. It slowly be! gan to lift up from its hover and ascended in a straight, vertical line up high in the sky to a point that it stopped and allowed for a passenger plane to pass by. I took a picture of the plane as it flew by, but the object was not visible for that brief instance. It stuck around for a few more minutes hovering and just like that it vanished. About an hour later, the same 4 black helicopters flew back by in the same area that the object was hovering. I don&rsquo;t know if there is any significance between the helicopters and the object, but it was very odd.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides little contact information.

My buddy and I had agreed not to report what we seen for fear that we would be laughed at.My parents live on the west side of Craig, Colorado, and I left there to pick my buddy up at his place which was a townhouse also on the west side of Craig.  The weather was a clear blue sky without any clouds so to speak.  We had decided we were going to go the Village Inn to eat and as we headed east on Highway 40/Victory Way toward the Village Inn my buddy said is that a &quot;jet&quot; as he pointed to the south side of town???  I said yeah that&apos;s a &quot;jet&quot; as I looked I could see a jet flying along with a vapor trail.  He said not there over there!  I looked and said I don&apos;t know what the h*ll that is.  As we were driving I noticed a guy walking along the highway that was looking in the direction of the object also.  I said lets get closer to it and we drove east and turned south on to Ranney Street.  We pulled up underneath the craft around the area of 1st Street.  I estimated it to be about 100-150 feet across and it looked like the common description of a saucer.  It had an eleva! ted center area and was disc shaped and was made of a very reflective and highly shiny metal.  I could see the sun reflecting on the side of it extremely bright!  I collaborated with my buddy the whole time to confirm what I was seeing.  At a distance it looked like the object was sitting in space on an exact point without moving at all.  When we got closer I could tell the object was rotating about a central axis like a top at an extreme speed.  It was holding exact position without a bobble and didn&apos;t make a sound.  We sat there and looked at it in awe when it started rotating faster and faster!  I said it&apos;s speeding up on its rotation right?  My buddy said yes it is.  Then it began to change shape flattening out like a cigar with the elevated center area completely gone and then in an instant it vanished completely!  I asked my buddy am I seeing things or did it just vanish!  He exclaimed yes it vanished completely.  This first time seeing the object I guessed it lasted ! about 12 minutes.  I looked further south and said there it is! again! We sped south to the intersection that heads east to the golf course and airport.  It was hovering like before and we sat there and looked at it again and like before it changed shape and vanished!  This time the viewing was for about 5 minutes.  Then we seen it again east of the airport so we headed east and as we got up on it began to change shape once again like before and in an instant it was gone.  It never reappeared after this time.  The whole duration of us watching the object was probably around 20 minutes.  We honestly couldn&apos;t believe what we just saw.  If I was to see a UFO I always thought it would be a brief passing in the night.  I&apos;ll never forget this that&apos;s for sure.  We seen this object so often and I had heard of abduction and people having their memories erased.  We checked our watches pretty closely to make sure there was no missing time.  I think I would still be scared to be hypnotized.  My buddy was from Grand Junction, Colorado and I haven&apos;t talked ! to him in years.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

20100110,20100110," Kapolei, HI", light,30-40 secs,"Re Submitted per Mr. Davenport request to detail the light description of objects.01.09.2010  While watering my grass at about 2135 hrs in Kapolei Hawaii, I witnessed two bright orb&rsquo;s swarming acrobatic like around one another over the SW part of the Island.The Blue and Green lights were like someone pointing a bright flashlight at you from a distance.  The color and intensity resembled laser light.  It was neither incandescent nor florescent but very bright light like a high intensity LED.  The lights both gave out two small sharp rays of light from the orb&rsquo;s body at a 45 degree angle towards the ground.  The trail of light  were small but visible. I thought it was someone pointing a laser light into the air but it was very bright and showed no trail from the laser&rsquo;s origin.I stared at the two lights for about 30 seconds in shock trying to make out what it could be, initially I thought it was a hovering helicopter or a UAV but they moved way to fast and in different directions for it to be any aircraft I have ever seen.  At one time the blue orb shot straight upwards into a low cloud and then regrouped with the green orb.I got my video camera but couldn&rsquo;t get a focus on the objects in time before they disappeared into the horizon.Both orbs are assumed to be at a estimated 5 to 10 thousand feet or more off my line of sight above the horizon.  My estimated of its location is off shore of the Chevron Oil processing plant in West Oahu, about 3 miles north of the Barbers Point Light House.I can not tell if it was over land or not but seemed to be just off shore.  It was impossible to get a scale size of the objects but that they seemed close to land.I called my friend who works at the ATC tower in Honolulu Airport but he called back and stated no reports from the tower.  I also contact a friend on the west side of the island but stated that he saw nothing.  The news had no reports as well.I am sure someone else saw it too.

I was not wearing glasses nor could I explain what I saw by finding any reflective surfaces within the field of view.Three lights, a little larger than a star appears, appeared to the left of the moon (about 3 deg) and were moving as soon as I saw them.  I think the lights were white, but the event was so short that I&rsquo;m really not sure.  They moved across 60 deg of my field of view within less than 2 seconds from the same inclination of the moon to about 10deg lower.  My view was then blocked by a tree so I couldn&rsquo;t see where they went.  I walked to where I could see behind the tree and the lights were gone.The lights were aligned along the axis of movement, but were slightly out of alignment.  I would have thought this to be a jet except that it was moving way too fast and there was no sound at all.  If it were close to account for the movement, there should have been sound (the early morning was silent).  If it were far to explain lack of sound then it was moving way too fast.My background:",
20100111,20100111," Delta, OH", light,30 minutes,"Large hovering light that changed into five separate, smaller lights.At about 18:00 on Sunday November 15th I was at work, in the forklift pulling hot steel coils off of the beam and placing them outside in the storage yard.  I looked up in the northern sky and saw an extremely bright but small light traveling east in a straight line and it just looked very wrong and out of place.  It was hard to put my finger on what was wrong about it.  The light was too bright, it didn&apos;t strobe or blink, but it was changing.  I didn&apos;t think of this at the time, it only occurred to me the next day, but I think one reason that it looked so out of place is that I see plane after plane, all night long, make their landing descents towards Toledo Express Airport, but all of those landing descents take place in the southern sky - well south of my position at work.  But this light was in the northern sky.Anyway, I didn&apos;t think much of it, other than a kind of &quot;that was weird&quot; notion, and I went back inside to pull another coil off the beam.  This time when I came back to the storage yard outside, there was the brightest light I&apos;ve ever seen in my life sitting in the northern sky.  I literally said out loud &quot;Oh my God!&quot;  The brightness of it looked like someone was welding or torch-cutting the sky.  That&apos;s the best I can describe it.  If you&apos;ve ever looked at somebody welding without a visor on - it was that level of brightness.  It was stationary - it was not moving, and it was huge.  I&apos;m not good at estimating it&apos;s size but I would figure it was maybe about the size of 4 or 5 two-story houses put together.  It did not have a shape.  It was constantly changing.  &quot;Boiling&quot; is almost a good description of its manner and consistency.  It was like a bubbling glob of light in the sky.  It&apos;s colors alternated between white, red, and green.  Now I know that white, red, and gree! n are the colors of every single airplane at night but I assure you this was no airplane nor did it even remotely resemble an airplane.  It didn&apos;t have lights that were blinking or changing color, it was light and it was changing color, and it was doing so about thirty times a second.  I would compare it to when someone blows into a pinwheel.  That&apos;s how rapid the color-change was occurring.  I&apos;m also not good at estimating it&apos;s altitude but I would roughly guess somewhere around 5000 feet or so.  It was a clear night, but had there been clouds, it would have been below them.I called my coworker on the radio and asked if he was in the office.  He said that he was so I told him to step outside and look above Winchesters (the truck stop on the corner of State Route 109 and County Road H.) &quot;WHAT THE F**K IS THAT!?!&quot; he said.&quot;Ok, I&apos;m just making sure someone else is seeing this,&quot; I said.It was absolutely amazing.  My heart was racing, my hands were shaking, and it wasn&apos;t out of any kind of fear.  It was out of excitement and out of the fact that this didn&apos;t belong or have any logical place in the sky that I&apos;ve been looking at all of my life.  This made no sense.  We watched transfixed as the light behaved the way I described above for a minute or two.Then, while we were sitting there watching it, two much smaller orbs came off of it (out of it, through it, I don&apos;t know) and began to fly independently.  The main light was stationary but these orbs came off of it and flew east.  My coworker and I started shouting and swearing like lunatics, making sure the other had just seen that happen.  After the two orbs flew off, they began to increase in size and brightness and the main light began to decrease.  Soon all three lights were the same size.  At this point, I grabbed my cell phone and called my fiance because I wanted her to go outside and see if she could see this from Swanton.  She didn&apos;t answer but she still has the voicemail I left describing the event as it was happening.  I did not think to try and take a picture but I doubt much would have shone through a cellphone camera anyway.  In hindsight, I should have tried to call everyone I know.Soon the three lights formed the shape of a triangle and then held it for a minute or so.  Then a fourth light appeared out of nowhere.  The other three lights broke their triangle formation and began flying around.  The flying was not dramatic in the sense that they were zipping all around the sky, because that was not the case at all.  Almost all of the flying was relatively slow but it was obvious that these lights could, and were, moving in any direction they wanted.  They could fly in a direction, stop on a dime, then head back the other way.  Same thing with up or down.  It did seem very deliberate to me and impossibly exact.  It wasn&apos;t chaotic.  At one point, they formed a straight line, at another they would be jumbled together.  I don&apos;t know if there was any noise because I was in the forklift but my coworker didn&apos;t hear anything.  The most I saw was five lights flying at the same time.Then, one of the lights flew in a straight line heading east, away from the rest of the lights.  Once a considerable distance away, it stopped and then dimmed completely into disappearance.  At the exact moment that it was dimming away, a new light began to shine into existence in the western sky, on the other side of the rest of the lights.  This would continue for a while.  One of the lights would fade out while another one would simultaneously fade into existence.  But that wasn&apos;t always the case.  Sometimes two would fade out and no new ones would appear.All the while, I had work to do so I had to keep returning to the beam to grab coils but then I would sit and watch the lights for a minute or two before I would have to return to the building again.  The whole incident from start to finish was about a half hour.  The whole time it was occurring it looked like the event as a whole was slowly moving north.  At around 18:25 all I could see was one large light in the sky, just like it had started, but it was much further north than when it first appeared.  Then, around 18:30 I returned to the building to grab another coil and when I returned the light was gone and I never saw it again.Luckily I have a witness to back this story up but I didn&apos;t think that was going to be valuable or even be an issue.  I could not wait to get home to watch the news that night because I thought for sure every single person that was traveling on the Ohio Turnpike or Airport Highway (Rt. 2) had to either be calling this in or recording it.  To me, there is no way anyone traveling on either road could have missed this;  Or anyone in Fulton County, for that matter, with a view of the northern sky.  I honestly expected helicopters or airplanes to arrive at any minute to investigate.  This was too unmissable, unnatural, and bright to be missed by anyone in the area.  I thought for sure this was going to be story #1 on every single news program that night.  So you can imagine how disappointed I was that night when there was no mention of anything on the news.  To this day, I cannot find anything about strange lights or UFOs on any of the local channels&apos; or the Toledo Blade&apos;s we! bsites.  I&apos;ve also searched YouTube to see if any footage has been posted - If there has been, I haven&apos;t found it.  But I&apos;ve also searched YouTube to see if I can find any footage at all from around the world that resembles what I saw that night.  So far, I&apos;ve found a clip or two that is similar, but nothing at all that makes me go: &quot;There!  That is what I saw!&quot;  It is surprisingly frustrating.The only tiny piece of validation I have, other than a 2nd eye witness, was a friend of mine who works at the Air National Guard base at Toledo Express Airport.

20100111,20100111," Tomball, TX", unknown,10-15 SECONDS,"Four straight ,horizontal lights on one 40-60&apos; structure, 150-200 ft in the air just above the tree line (Tomball TX)I was driving home down the same road I have traveled hundreds of times before for the past 5 years.  When I came around a slight curve, just before a long straight away, I noticed lights ahead of me and to the right just above the tree line.  The lights were not immensely bright, like a star or a spot light, but more like soft, white lights seen in recessed fixtures, which these looked very similar to.  There were four lights in a straight, horizontal line, with equal distance inbetween each light(approx. 10-15 ft)and seemed to be fixed in relation to one another.  Since there is only an empty pasture in the area the lights were over, it struck me as very odd to see them there.   While attempting to grasp an idea of what type of aircraft would be that low (150-200 ft approx) I was assuming I would see a newly constructed drilling rig in the field with an illuminated light platform.   But as I approached, slowing down to get a better look, I realized the object! seemed to be moving southwest towards my north-northwest approach.  My wife, who was just ahead of me in another vehicle, did not see the lights at all as she passed.  There was a vehicle right behind me on this two lane road,so I couldn&apos;t stop - as I wanted to.  Instead I slowed to a crawl as I reached the spot the lights were hovering or flying by, leaning forward as much as possible to see to my right if I could see a structure attaching the lights.  At the same time I rolled my window down to see if I could hear a jet engine or roto blades as I passed.  The only thing I could hear was my truck engine and the road.  I believe the object passed over me from the passenger side as  I passed the spot I originally saw them at.  I looked back over my right shoulder to see if I could see the back side of the lights and I couldn&apos;t see anything.  I drove into my neighborhood, constantly looking back to see if I could see anything and there was nothing there.  My wife and I grabb! ed a video camera from the house and drove back out minutes la! ter to s ee if we could see anything at all and there was nothing else unusual.  The next day we drove down the same road several times, taking pictures of the area the lights were seen.  By estimating the one stand of trees just in front of the lights, I would guess the lights were just above them at 150-200 ft. above the ground.  The night I saw the lights was very clear, no clouds.  Intercontinental Airport is due east of my house and the local airport is northwest of it. Planes were all around that night, but at about 3500 ft at the lowest.",

I had been just looking through beyond the balcony, sliding glass door, while in the living room of the apartment, and I noticed an egg-shaped, probably flat, silver object.  It had black trim on the top and the bottom, and it appeared to have a round black area in the center of it.  It moved in a direction from north to south.  It was probably no larger than 5 feet from top to bottom.  It moved steadily in a perfect horizontal line without going up or down.  It made no noise.  It must have hovered flown no higher than 25 feet above the ground.  After it passed the line of sight of my balcony window, I then noticed that five wild geese flew down from the opposite direction to the grassy area across from the parking lot below the apartment.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.

(It is not uncommon to see jets in the sky over northeastern West Virginia, but seeing three of them fly so close together and in the same direction is a rarity.) Within minutes, many more similar objects appeared, all with the same general heading, coming from multiple directions (most were coming from the south, and a few were coming from the north). At this time, there were about 10-15 objects in the sky. All of these objects had vapor trails, which is why I assume they were jets, but I began to notice that three or four of the trails were distinctly different from the rest; they had a slight blueish tint, and seemed to flash or flicker. I then noticed that one or two of the objects seemed to be traveling vertically, toward! the ground (albeit at a very high altitude); I didn&apos;t notice when these objects appeared or if they had been traveling west like the others, but I did notice that their trails were curved, as if they had been flying from the west to the south-east, then suddenly and drastically changed their pitch. I lost visual contact shortly after this as I was traveling in a different direction, but the event might have lasted longer. I believe some of these objects might have been meteorites or debris entering the atmosphere. I am unsure if this event has been reported, but perhaps the nearby North Central West Virginia Airport (CKB) would have some information about the incident.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

Hi I&apos;m a homeowner / observer from  .... yep, Gulf Breeze FL .  I have a report on a recent sighting that should match up with other reports in the area.

As it approached the middle of the bay, about 3-4 seconds since I noticed the object, it made a downward 180 degree turn at the same rate of speed.  I dropped the garbage bag in the driveway, and knew that what I was seeing was not anything in our publicly known aviation inventory. My view was obscured from about 15 degrees from the horizon to the top of the tree line to my North. The object would dive below and above the trees moving in a very similar pattern as a dragonfly. After approx. 2 minutes of viewing I was able to signal my neighbor to be a witness.. after about a minute or two the object shot skyward from it&apos;s last position below the tree line as if it were staying in ! a particular piece of airspace in the middle of the bay, approx 1/2 mile wide and below 4000ft.  I should also mention there was a thin cloud layer around 5000ft which helped me judge the distance and scale of the light sphere.  At times the object would traverse and incredible speeds, well in excess of mach2-3 without breaking the sound barrier and without making any audible sound from approx 1mi away.  Traffic from Hwy98 was audible as well as several single engine recreational aircraft off in the distance, west and south of the activity, approx 8-15 miles. The last maneuver the object made was from west to east it climbed to approx 4000ft, turned north, &ldquo;zig-zagged&rdquo; in an S pattern and vanished after the 3rd &ldquo;zag&rdquo;, not to be seen again.Shortly after a single rotor helicopter came on site ( pursuit ) from west to east along the original path of the sphere, and turned north toward Whiting Field NAS.  No other aircraft approached the area except for a commercial flight leaving PNS traveling North-East, which tells me the airspace was not locked down.  I was under the impression that this object wanted to show-off and be seen.  Also another observation was 3 satellites at 90 degrees elevation, magnitude about +4, intersecting directly above shortly after the sighting.I&apos;m still in awe over this observation.  I&apos;m very familiar with military aviation and aeronautical engineering.  This sphere was defying our physics somehow by moving through the atmosphere at those speeds without disturbing the air.

Smith Arkansas during these sightings and I can clearly remember being brought outside so view the unidentified aircraft.  Although I was very young  (4 or 5 years old), I can clearly remember a few items:  - The unidentified aircraft were clearly flying in formation.My father (recently discharged from the Army) viewed the behavior and maneuvering of the aircraft as unusual.Multiple people in our neighborhood were out in the evening viewing the aircraft with a collective uneasiness bordering on panic.Real-time media reports (radio &amp; TV) followed the incident.The local paper had front page coverage, with photographs, the next day.Less clear memories include recollection of the unidentified aircraft hovering and/or landing at the airport and of military aircraft in pursuit (roar of jet engines and visible identification of military aircraft separate from unidentified aircraft).The timeframe for the sighting is only approximate, but -must- have occurred prior to the fall of 1966.  My family moved to St. Louis in the fall of 1966 (where I entered kindergarten)  Media coverage of this incident was extensive, so I am perplexed why there is no existing and/or available records of this.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

The best way I can describe it is that is looked like a giant flying cruise ship with all of its lights on.  It was completely dark that night and the shape of the object other than the lights was difficult to distinguish.  It was difficult to get a distance on the object as it was so big.  If it was close to us (within say half a mile) I would estimate it was 300 to 400 yards or more in length and maybe 80 to 120 yards or more high.  If it was further away, it was bigger than that.  The object was flying in a northerly direction at a fairly slow speed and not at high elevation.  It flew out of sight heading over the mountains.I am guessing at the date of this sighting as I think I was 32 years old at the time.

I will get video if this continues.  It seems to disappear by slowly circling down towards the ground as it gradually drops out of view.

This was early on November 6th, 2009 in Saquarema, a beach town in Rio, Brasil with only low rise homes. It was quiet and dark all around except for one light inside the room on my right. My friend was sitting by a table on the same veranda and stepped inside for just a couple of minutes.First sitting:  This was around 03:00 or later and as I leaned my head back on the hammock I looked straight up and saw 3 reddish orange lights, shaped in a triangle, equidistant from each other, all the same size, approximately the size of a nickel coin at arm&rsquo;s length.These 3 lights were not moving, just still in one same spot, strong lights but not shinny nor flickering, each one was the same and had no variation of color.From the angle I was looking (up) they were in an arrow shape and I can&rsquo;t remember if this way  : -   or this way  - :  , and I was quiet, analyzing what I was looking at when just before my friend stepped back to the veranda, these lights all of a sudden, altogether in the same shape took off to the right at lightning speed, they did not leave any streak behind, and I could not follow them further because the roof of the house created an obstacle to my view. This entire sighting seems to have lasted only about 10-15 seconds, just enough to appreciate it. There was no sound from the lights the entire event.Second sitting:  I immediately made a comment to my friend of what I had seen pointing in the direction of where the lights had gone but at the same time I looked around the sky when I spotted another single light, of a smaller size, about the size of a dime coin at arm&rsquo;s length but white, it was further away and not overhead and located in the opposite direction from where the other 3 orangey red lights had gone. This whiter light was similar to the color of any big star in the sky but bigger, and it was also standing still when I saw it, just bright, not flickering, and just as I was guessing it was not a star it zoomed off horizontally that other way (to the left) to quickly disappear in the black.My conclusions: What I saw had nothing to do with the characteristics of any balloons, nor fireworks, nor any earthly manmade airplanes, nor a manmade satellite, nor falling stars or comet, nothing that we know made today on Earth can move as fast and silently in the sky from a still position. It was definitely something not Terrestrial.Me: I believe in non-human extraterrestrial intelligence existence. I have been a photographer for many years but did not even try to get my camera so not to take my eyes off of what I was seeing, and it lasted only seconds anyhow. I have always wanted to see a &ldquo;UFO&rdquo;, a real one myself, not in pictures. I was not scarred, I was not surprised, I would say I was momentarily perplexed. I just looked up, saw what I saw, and enjoyed it.And: To my curiosity I googled the date of my ufo sitting and was pleased to see that someone from the beach in Saquarema photographed a strange dot in the sunset sky over the ocean the day before.

This peaked my interest and I went outside to check, but saw nothing. I returned inside and a few minutes later, the infrared cameras picked it up again.  I then inspected the perimeter of the building and searched up and down the adjacent streets; it was then that I noticed a bright red object to the NorthWest of my location.

I continued to keep an eye on the object, which was descending and/or getting brighter.  Having seen MANY objects similar to this one over the past 9 months, I was very calm and prepared for almost anything.   But this was different.  I traveled no further than 8 blocks and traveled up a dead end street to the north.  All lights in the neighborhood dimmed, my truck lost power, and I was mesmerized as this Red Light became a shape. It descended even closer to me and literally came to within 100 Meters from my vehicle.  I pulled out my cell phone and began filming it.  The video details far more than what I saw... I saw a Red Craft maneuver from at least 15K feet altitude to 100 meters in front of me in 3-5 seconds!  I found myself face to face with something that looked like it had retro-rockets on it, and then an EXTREMELY bright light that it shined into my face, causing nausea, mild confusion and a severe headache.

It sent a message.  I feel ill right now and have what appear to be radiation burns on my fingers and symptoms of radiation sickness. The video when viewed  frame by frame, along with my narration, details a few seconds when the craft seemed to generate a &quot;plasma-like Orb&quot; and then swirled it around and shot a beam at me. Close analysis by my Dad and I found at the same moment, the glass of my vehicle warped, and I stopped talking, lost my bearing and then regained focus again.

Something shiny reflecting the sunlight caught my eye above the trees. There were three, boomerang shaped objects hovering right above the tree tops making no sound. They were larger than the size of a motorcycle but smaller than the size of an SUV. They were chrome silver in color, very shiny - unlike anything I have ever seen. I lost them over the tree tops. The traffic light changed and I had to turn onto the parkway to keep traffic moving. There were a lot of other cars on the road, this was during rush hour in broad daylight. There was not a cloud in the sky, it was beautiful weather conditions. I dismissed it thinking I may have been hallucinating since I couldn&apos;t make sense of it and they had disappeared...My Cell phone rang as I was driving and it was my mother.  I told her what I saw and she started asking me questions.  By this time I had pulled up to the light to get onto the very busy HWY 280.  I was in the turn lane to go NW onto HWY 280.  I was facing North and still on the phone with my mother looking up in the sky trying to see if I could find the objects again.  Sure enough they had made a circle from where I had originally spotted them and were flying over HWY 280 going in the same circular direction I had spotted them going in the first time only this time they were at a much higher altitude.  I told my mom I had to go b/c I was going to report this to 911 since this sighting was close to the eighth anniversary of September 11th and I didn&apos;t want to take the chance of it being some kind of terrorist surveillance or something of the sort.The light changed and I started to move away from the objects.  I pulled over into a parking lot and had my digital camera in my purse.  I pulled it out and got out of the car and waited for them to circle again.  They did return in the same flight path that I had seen them twice before but they were flying at an even higher altitude than they were the second time.  I tried to snap a picture but they were too far away from me at this point. I waited for them to circle around again but they disappeared.  I called 911 and the operator said she was getting similar reports and she was sending a sheriff&apos;s deputy to check it out.  I gave the operator my information and got back into my car and waited for them to fly over again.  Every single time i saw them they were flying in a V formation.  They were all the same size and color, hovering with no sound and could take off at speeds so fast that they seemed to disappear.  I watched them fly over the same restaurant but this time instead of continuing the circular flight path I had watched them make before they turned and flew NW over HWY 280 following the Westbound traffic.  They were flying lower than airplanes but higher than the tree line.  This time they disappeared but it wasn&apos;t like they took off it was as if they were invisible, they were there one minute and then the next they were not.  I didn&apos;t see them take off at a higher speed I just watched them disappear into thin air, it was as if they could make themselves invisible.I called my younger brother since he had a sighting near this area a few years before on a fishing trip to see if the shapes of the object were the same.  Mine were different in that they weren&apos;t completed triangles, they were shaped like boomerangs and were smaller in size than the object he saw.

The cabin is in a tiny town located in the Mt Baker Snoqualmie National Forest (outside the town of Granite Falls) in the western cascade mountains of Washington. The lights were very bright and were shining through my window at an angle that would indicate it was coming from the sky and lit up the second floor deck. I got up and went to the window and looked outside and then realized that the entire cabin was being lit up by some kind of a giant spot light.This is very strange as this area is very remote and there is no electricity. The other strange thing is that there was no noise at all, as I first assumed that the lights were coming from a helicopter or plane I listened to see if I could hear anything and I could only hear the creek running outside.I can quickly dismiss the lights coming from a helicopter, plane, or any type of nearby machinery because of the remote location of my cabin in this little town. The lights disappeared just after I got up to look out the window. When I got up, the first thing I thought about was that there was a search helicopter hovering around, but as I said there was no noise or rumbling at all. The light on the cabin was very large and bright and was not wavering around, it was very still.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

Twice as bright as the ever is on its brightest night. It was moving from west to east. At first i thought it was a satalite. But i realized it was much to bright. My mind was racing trying to figure out what could be so bright in the sky. Im absolutley sure it was not a plane. It made no noise had no flashing lights and was way to bright. Its was not a meteor, There was no tail and the object moved in a straight line perfect to the horizon. The light began to fade. I thought it was going behind clouds. But the sky was clear and i could see stars all around the area of the object. And not a could anywhere i! n the sky! It faded fairly quickly until it was just gone. I brought my daughter quickly inside. Handed her off to her mother and went right back out to watch for more. In a matter of three minutes i was back outside scanning the north horizon when i saw a jet flying the exact same path. I could see the flashing lights of the jet and hear the roar of the engines. I stayed outside for another 20 minutes and saw one satalite. The satalite was much dimmer and much slower than the object i saw.

I didn&apos;t see any clouds in the sky.I was on my way to work traveling down W. Seven Pines in Lamar, SC. I just crossed over route 403 and continued on down Seven Pines.  I immediately saw a silver reflection in the sky to my left over a huge bare-ground field.

It was very clear to see.The object was at least 2,000 - 3,000 feet up, traveling very slowly back the opposite direction from me.  This is very unusual as I travel this road every day for the past 2 years and have NEVER seen a plane or any object for that matter traveling over this field or anywhere near it at this early in the morning.The object could have been a plane, but I was staring at it and could not see any wings at all.  The object was very long, silver, and shaped like the typical cigar shape other people report, and was incredibly shiny from the sun reflecting off it&apos;s body.I pulled over onto the side of the road and watched it slowly move on at about 20 - 30 miles an hour, estimated.

I will list below the year and what was going on at that time.1985  My 1st sighting, I was in 6th grade, we just came home from food shopping, it was late, my dads friend stopped by, I went into the backyard to help with the groceries, while talking to my dads friend, I noticed lights above me, when I looked up, I saw a large, round craft that was encircled with lights, it moved so slow, I stood there watching it, as it was barely above my home, I asked my dads friend &ldquo;What is that&rdquo; he stated &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo;. We watched it moved towards my garage, then past the alley, then disappeared out of sight. It was so strange, I never spoke of it. This sighting was in Upland, CA   1989 I was 16, while driving to pick up my friend who lived in Ontario, CA, I noticed an object moving quickly through the sky, it was cylinder in shape. What caught my eye, is that while flying, the craft seemed to be flipping, or turning, it was so strange, that I found myself watching it, suddenly just disappeared. This was in the evening, it was dark out.Summer 2000 While driving through Phoenix, AZ, it was late, I was on my way to California from Texas, the sky was changing colors rapidly which caught me and my brother&rsquo;s eye. It was about dusk, when the first craft appeared out of clouds it came, suddenly there were 2, then next thing we knew, there were 5. We started to talk about the crafts and it was like they heard us. The crafts were round, and almost in formation style, when one craft lifts looked like they were signaling to the others, then the others started to signal back. The next thing we knew we were being followed by the crafts, I know it sounds strange, but they stayed with us till we reached our destination. I was so scared I even stopped at some gas station to call my husband, and mom to tell them I was being followed and didn&rsquo;t know what to do, of course they didn&rsquo;t believe me, needless to say, I never pulled over to sleep that night, and drove straight through to California. During the time I was driving ! they would put a light on us, then back away, they would hide behind building then pop out of know where, then they drive along side our car. I had never been so scared, and it really sucked no one believed us. March 2009 My daughter actually seen this one, she states she was in her room, when she heard a noise, she walked to the window to see 2 crafts, one was hovering above the other. The other one was in our backyard, hovering, she states it was round with lights all around it. She states after a few minutes, it finally started moving towards the front of the house, she came running downstairs saying &ldquo;I just seen a UFO it going to the front&rdquo; so we all ran out to the front porch, but we did not see anything.

Light was flickering irregularly but not blinking in a pattern, no other color lights seen.No sound from object, closing from ~ 4nm to 2nm (estimated based on ceiling and elevation, &quot;2nm&quot; being about 11,000&apos; directly overhead). Single-engine propeller aircraft heard to the northwest, apparently over water, but not correlated to the object.Based on altitude of 11,000&apos; (reported ceiling) speed credible for either jet or turboprop aircraft, not credible for balloon (too fast) or meteor (too slow). Also based on observation that object entered cloud cover from below and did not emerge from it, object assumed to be gaining in altitude throughout observation.Went inside to get binoculars (just inside front door) and 10-y/o daughter. Went back out, object still visible, now moving &quot;faster&quot; (probably same speed but closer), now clearly having turned perhaps 45 degrees to the left and moving toward the west. Nearly overhead, observed with binoculars, slowly disappeared into clouds. Still no sound. Not seen again.Flight path not consistent with Boeing Field or Seatac. McChord AFB possible but unlikely.Note: Both Weather Underground site (copied below) and Boeing Field report clear skies, but actually heavily overcast, altostratus. Weather Underground also reports light northerly wind, but actual observation was southerly at 5 knots.Daughter (10 years old), also had binoculars but was unable to get them out of case in time and only saw it with unaided eyes, descibes as &quot;a fireball in the sky, like a very very furry animal&apos;s tail, while the animal&apos;s tail was poofed up, like a very angry cat&apos;s tail&quot;.Note: Daughter did not see object (she had been inside) until it was entering the clouds, I think this is what she means. Prior to that the object was a very distinct single source of light.Other than the fact that the object was not in a typical flight path, nothing about it&apos;s movement or speed seemed irregular for a conventional jet or turboprop aircraft. What was striking was it&apos;s coloration, and the fact that it was clearly flickering or flaring, but not &quot;blinking&quot; in any regular pattern. Also substantially brighter than conventional aircraft.Personal Background: Ex-Navy (navigation), captain US Merchant Marine, celestial navigation instructor, astronomy major in college (i.e., no, it wasn&apos;t Venus, a meteor or the ISS).Daughter is a typical ten-year-old, but has been stargazing with me since she was a toddler.Note: Your form asks for shape and number of &quot;craft&quot;.

The light was coming from the oject and not a reflection of the moon or stars.  I ran to the window but it was out of sight being too late to get another look.  I then opened the window to see if I could hear any sound.  There was no sound or the object was too far away for me to hear (I am partly deaf).  Grabbing my 10 power binoculars I ran outside thinking it was a plane crash and would see light or smoke.   I saw none.   Looking into the sky I did see a red blinking light of what I thought was a jet aircraft or passenger liner, flying above where the object went down.  The aircraft was going in a north to south direction, very high and I followed it for a few seconds with my binoculars.  My first thought was that a piece of the aircraft had come off and was falling to earth.  I dismissed this notion as the two objects were seemingly not related.  I tried to find the white object but was not successful.  I then ran back into the house for my silva compass and plotted the direction of decent as South 84 degrees East (declination of 20 degrees).    After a few minutes, the object did not reappear. the esitimated distance to the object is estimated as 1-2miles but distance at night is uncertain.  The sky was clear and the stars were out (34 degrees F), with no wind nor clouds.  The 1/4-1/5th moon (a sliver of light) was in the west, the direction to the object was to the east.  The object is not the moon and is too large to be stars.  I dismiss the object as a meteroite (previously seen meteroites) as the rate of decent was too slow.

Then off to the north another object that looked exactly like the one we were watching came in close to the first one and stopped a distance from it, about three or four lengths of the object away.  They stayed there for a few seconds stationary.  Then the second object took off angling up into the sky to the west rapidly getting smaller and smaller and when it was just about out of sight it turned and came back toward us and passed over us a! t a very hig attutide and continued out of sight to the east.  The first object just kept moving on to the west slowly and was almost out of sight when we got home about 5 mins later.  This object is multi-colored and give off beams of light down from it.  It appears to be either round or oval it is hard to determine the exact shape as the colors are very bright and keep changing.",

The lights were very bright and moved in a pattern that a regular aircraft does not usually follow.  The second time we heard the noise it shook the whole house.  I went out the front door this time and again saw the bright lights they were flying east bound and then simply like putting a car in reverse headed back west bound.

She does drink alcohol but no alcohol was in her system for at least 24 hours prior to event.Note: The rest of this report will be &quot;penned&quot; in the first-person context by the Observer.Event: I was getting ready to finally get some sleep after a long week of work, and admittedly, was extremely tired. The hour was very late, but I am actually very accustomed to not getting much sleep. As I was getting ready for bed, I heard what I would describe as a screeching/crackling sound that sounded almost like an animal, though I can&apos;t figure out what type. I went outside my front door to my yard, which is 30 meters from the street and extremely dark. No lights were on in the front portion of the house so there was a very clear view of the sky. The witness exited a few seconds behind me and we both heard the noise again and noticed at approximately 75 degrees E from our location / 20 degrees above the horizon, a dull-white craft circling around the North End of Boise. It was just below the cloud deck which was estimated to be approximately 1800 feet above the ground. It emitted noise a third time and circled around in a somewhat erratic manner. I reached for an extr! emely bright flashlight (StreamLight STRION LED), which is basically about as bright as the high beams of a car... I shined it towards the craft. There was no reflection. However, it did produce the following reactions and data.1) Craft stopped suddenly and started heading towards us 2) Craft changed shape and luminosity became greater 3) There was a noticeable crackle sound in the atmosphere (similar to lightning in the distance; note that there was no precipitation nor any Stratocumulus clouds or similar type clouds to produce lightning--nor were the weather conditions such to generate lightning) 4) Craft appeared to be approximately 1000 feet away (based on known distance that flashlight can illuminate and known distance of background objects) 5) Craft was estimated to be about 8-10 meters in diameter  Craft circled for the first 15-18 seconds, then stopped, changed shape and headed towards us, became much brighter, then headed North at an estimated 300-400 mph before disappearing above the clouds.Although there is Boise Airport and Gowen Field, there were no aircraft flying. I have an application (FlightTracker Pro) that tracks flights (including some military aircraft without N-numbers). There was 100% cloud coverage so it was not a planet, star, or satellite. Also note that I track the ISS with &apos;ISSLite&apos;, and satellites with TLE Files on &apos;Satellite Tracker&apos;  I do not know what this object was, but it was the latest in a flurry of objects that I&apos;ve witnessed above Boise in the past year.

Please come forward if you have any sightings in Boise as I personally can attest to at least 30 that in my opinion, were not aircraft, atmospheric effects, other manmade craft/materials, or near or far space base objects (stars/planets/etc).

I paused for awhile to look thinking that these maybe falling stars but the trajectory of the movements were about horizontal (zig-zagging smoothly) and one star-like object following (chasing?) the other.  These two star-like objects looked about 5-10x larger than an airplane in the night sky but moving much faster (maybe &gt;&gt; 20x ).  The objects were also much closer to the ground.

I enjoyed walking my dog and on this particular day I had chosen a relatively quiet area, where Scud, my dog, could run around freely.  This area is known as the lower southern plateau, at the very tip-end of the Rock, from where you can see the Mediterranean Sea to the East, the Strait that divides Europe from Africa to the South, and the Atlantic Ocean, which lies to the West.  I remember sitting on the edge of a cliff and was facing the Mediterranean Sea.   Although the reader may find it difficult to believe, I felt compelled to look in the general direction of a natural elevation (the edges of the Upper Plateau) that stood behind me about 120 metres away.  Over this elevation you find a military enclave that includes an enormous and conspicuous white spherical radar.  There, I saw this metallic round-shaped craft, hovering motionlessly and making absolutely no noise or sound whatsoever.  It just stood there for nearly an hour, above the radar at about 75 feet from the ground. Suddenly, it vanished as if it had imploded.  The next day, GBC TV showed footage of an enourmous baseball shaped craft, from where a small sphere descended into a nearby Spanish oil-refinery and then slowly climbed up again only to vanish seconds after.  Interestingly, there had been a wildfire on the Rock that was put out only one day before my particular sighting. Thank you.",

Seeing as he had a telescope on a tripod sitting near him on the deck, he decided to grab it and get a closer look.What had appeared to be a cylindrical or cigar shaped object moving back and forth, was actually more of a disc shaped object, silvery or grayish in color, that was flying in a circular pattern when spotted through the telescope.He watched it circling for about another minute, give or take, when suddenly it took off at an angle, upward and out of sight at a very fast rate of speed, and disappeared into the clouds.

20100122,20100122," Bandon, OR", other,15 minutes,"Close Encounter of the 5th KindLast night (1/20/10) at 6:00 pm I sat down on a hill on our 80 acre ranch in Bandon, OR.  Immediately after sitting down I began meditating.  I visualized in my mind my exact location.  First I began far out in space looking at the entire United States, and then I moved into Oregon, then to the Coast, then to the Bandon area.  After that I repeatedly drew my zipcode in my mind.  Then, in my mind still, I traced the roads that lead to my property.  When I had finished giving this mental beacon I watched the sky.  At approx. 6:45 pm I witnessed white lights dancing on the horizon.  Each time they made a sudden flash or sharp turn I would hold my lighter up and flash back.  Soon they were coming closer to me.  When they passed behind a cloud nearly above my head I did not see them for 10 seconds or so.  I looked back at the horizon to see if they had retreated there and when I looked back up in the sky above my head I saw a blazing orange trapezoid (sides longer than top ! and bottom) appear approx. 300 ft. up just inside the bottom of the cloud layer.  It&apos;s size was equal to a baseball at arms length.  It got very bright and slowly dissipated.  I had not been frightened when I saw them at a distance on the horizon, but once it was right above my head I became very frightened.  Just as the trapezoid vanished another light with the same color appeared in the trees on the property adjacent to ours.  I knew there were no lights conventional lights where this light had manifested.  The orange light flashed 5 or 6 times.  At this point I was too afraid to continue with the experience.  Later, I kicked myself for not investigating.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))((ADDENDUM FROM ANONYMOUS SOURCE)) This is an adjunct to my sighting report of January 21st, 2010.  As reported, I witnessed a fire orange trapezoid shape illumined in the sky approx. 300 ft. above my head and 30-40 ft. in front of me following an observation of three white lights dancing on the horizon.  Just as the trapezoid disappeared a light of the same color lit up a patch of forest on an adjacent property where I knew there should not be any source of light.  Obviously this was quite shocking for me.  The next day I walked up to the same spot I had been standing the previous night.  I was questioning my sighting and sanity because it was just too vivid and close.  It is one thing to see lights dancing around far off in the atmosphere, but it is quite another experience to have something happen directly over your head at a close distance.  So I went up there again to see if I could see anything else in the daytime.  I watched the sky where the trapezoid had appeared for five minutes or so and decided that I would go back to the house.  When my eyes retreated from the sky and came down to Earth I saw something very strange on the ground directly below the spot where I had seen the trapezoid.  I approached the strange spot on the ground.  It was the body of my dog that went missing approx. 2 months previous.  I was shaken when I put all the events of the past 24 hours together.  It is my feeling that this is not at all a case of animal mutilation, rather, it is my strong conviction that I was led to the spot for a sign of intent on behalf of whatever force was controlling the lights in the sky.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We kept talking to each other about the details, trying to explain what we saw, and we couldn&apos;t explain it, only talk about it.I&apos;ll let my wife type now!  Thanks!   Report from wife:  First of all, let me preface this by saying I never thought I&apos;d be saying or seeing anything like this, but I did, along with my husband, and we feel we should tell someone who won&apos;t think we&apos;ve gone off the deep end!   LOL   You may share our story if you want to, but we would strongly ask to remain anonymous.  We could accurately be portrayed as a middle-aged (ugh! LOL) married couple in Modesto.  My husband is a professional whose name is recognizable to those in his field, and I hope you understand and respect our need to remain anonymous to anyone other than yourself.That being said, here&apos;s what happened:  (pasted here from what I wrote directly after seeing whatever it was we saw.  My husband and I &quot;compared notes&quot; as I typed, and are in agreement with everything detailed in the following account.)  Jan 13, 2010 approx. 11:20 pm PST, in Modesto, CA, my husband and I were in our backyard to take the dog out for the night.   The sky was very clear, and we were looking at the stars while waiting for the dog to &quot;go potty.&quot;   My husband suddenly said, &quot;Look!  What IS that?&quot; and pointed up, towards the NW sky, but somewhat overhead.There was something flying very steadily, at a moderate speed - hard to say exactly how fast, not knowing how high the object really was, or how large it may have been, given unknown altitude.  But, we had the impression it was somewhat low-flying, and fairly large in size.It was completely silent.So much so, it was almost dream-like in a way.  It just didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;compute&rdquo; that something could be doing that and not make a sound.It was definitely not a balloon, moving too evenly and directly.  No &quot;wobble&quot; or any variance in its trajectory or speed - very smooth, perfectly straight line, perfectly consistent speed.  It flew directly over us on its path.  I have no doubt whatsoever it was moving of its own power.  And this is hard to explain, but it was as if it was maintaining its level, speed and smoothness with no effort - as if gravity, air resistance or any of our conventional laws of physics were not an issue, if that makes any sense.There were no definite lights, however the entire object was dimly luminous.  It was certainly the source of the light itself, it was not a reflection or a beam of light.  Nor did it project any illumination or beam of light.  It just was kind of phosphorescent.  There were no visible markings at all.  It was not really bright, but sort of similar to how a light looks when turned low on a dimmer switch, or even less.  It didn&apos;t have finely exact definite edges - it was dim enough to appear somewhat diffuse, though the shape was completely discernable, and incomparable to anything known.   And it was definitely a solid object.The shape is difficult to describe - somewhat diamond gem shaped, but more rounded, sort of like a horseshoe crab shape without the tail.  We both had the impression we were looking at the bottom of the object without being able to see the sides.  The same perspective one would have if they held a plate or bowl overhead and could only see the bottom.The object continued on an absolutely straight path, traveling SE, and eventually we lost sight of it, after about 30 or 40 seconds from initially sighting it.What&apos;s strange, now that I consider it, is that it did not change in dimension, in other words, as it got further away, it didn&apos;t necessarily get commensurately smaller as one would expect from normal perspective, yet we both perceived it getting further away.  Very hard to explain.  But, it was as if it finally went out of sight more as a result of not being able to see its luminosity from that distance anymore, as opposed to it getting smaller and smaller.Oddly, I feel as if its shape did not change commensurately either, the further away it got, it did not appear to become more elliptical, as one would expect something of that shape to do in normal circumstances.  Nor did we perceive seeing &ldquo;sides&rdquo; or a &ldquo;top&rdquo; to it as one may expect.  Yet, somehow, we knew it was not paper-thin, we knew we were seeing the bottom of an object of undeterminable overall multiple dimensions.  Very, very difficult to explain adequately.Although my husband kept asking me, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; and I kept answering, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; we were both calm during the &quot;event&quot; - no feeling of fear or panic, more so a feeling of wondering or awe.  My husband felt it was a feeling of excitement, I felt strangely calm, but in wonderment.  It is only now, after the fact, that we are somewhat agitated, a little fearful I guess, and somewhat bewildered.  Like our logical minds are seeking an explanation.Something else odd &ndash; an estimated 8 to 10 minutes after our experience, a huge jet, definitely not a commercial passenger jet, flew over really low and fast, and was very, very loud.  We NEVER have anything like this in our area &ndash; only small planes, little commuter jets upon occasion, or commercial jets flying really high.  This thing sounded like a rocket or fighter jet, and was flying really low.  We had just come in the house, and upon hearing how loud this jet was, my husband ran back outside to see it.  He said that it went south, and then abruptly circled easterly, and then turned SE, and continued in the very direction we saw the object fly.  We just thought that was weird, especially considering what we had just seen.So &ndash; that&rsquo;s the story!   As fantastic as it sounds, I know what we saw, and have absolutely no idea what it was, and absolutely no doubt it was NOT anything conventional possibilities can explain.  It was like nothing I&rsquo;ve ever seen in my life.",

As I was about to get into the car, I saw a bright reddish-orange light in the sky moving slowly.  It was a shape of a circle.  My boyfriend was going to go home at that time and was about to leave.  I told him to stop the car and to look at the sky.  I asked him if that was a plane and he told me it was a small airplane.  But, I was thinking that it could not be a plane at all because it was moving too slowly and usually when you see airplanes at night you would see that it would have a blinking light and a sound passing thru.  This bright light I saw didn&apos;t have any sound and it was moving too slowly to even be an airplane. It was moving silently in the sky.  Plus, it was a bit cloudy at that time and this thing was flying low underneath the clouds.  My uncle was also out! side and it caught his eye.  We all were looking at it the whole time.  All of a sudden, that reddish-orange light I saw in the sky stopped moving.  Then, I told my boyfriend,&quot;is it just me because now that light just stopped in the sky and now it looks like a star, but it doesn&apos;t even look like a star.&quot;  Then, my boyfriend told me it wasn&apos;t just me, he also saw that thing move earlier and now it just stopped.  My uncle was also amazed. At that time, my sister was loosing her patience and was calling me to get into the car. I continued to look at it for another good five minutes.  It could not be a meteor or a comet.  It could not be a star because it wasn&apos;t twinkling at all.

After making sure there were no aircraft to be seen or heard in the area, we shone the laser pen at a few stars (you have to make sure there are no aircraft in the area, especially helicopters as it is very dangerous and ILLEGAL to point this thing in the sky when aircraft are present!).I shone the laser pointer at three stars in the sky which are shaped like a triangle, They&apos;re in the west of the sky and are visible most nights. After touching each star with the laser beam I put the laser pen into my back pocket and lit a cigarette while me and my friend chuckled because I was putting on a stupid voice while pointing at the stars.From the east and for approx 1-1.5 seconds a brilliant white sphere with no glare or tail. The object appeared as bright as magnesium burning as it passed over our heads at a speed which was far less than a shooting start, but much faster than any known plane or helicopter.There was no sound and the object looked to be very defined and solid (perfect sphere, or ball).I have seen many shooting stars, satellites, commercial/military planes and many helicopters.This object did not fit into any of these criteria, nor did it resemble a comet in any way.I have never seen a large meteor in person but have on video and this object did not in anyway resemble this either.The object was difficult to scale, my friend and I talked for a while and decided it to seemed to looked a little bigger than a passenger jet in the sky but lower than a jet would fly (30,000ft). We cannot verify any size or height of the object as it was very fast, very solid and very visible but so fast that it is hard to from memory alone judge.The object did however, fly quite precisely through the centre of the triangle of stars above, pretty much the centre of the three points I shone the laser!  I have created a couple of images using Google map to point out a rough flight path. I started small then worked out. Which I have emailed to yourselves.After returning inside My friend tried to use the GPS on his phone to work out the direction of the craft, but the GPS did not work when it usually does there. It said we were out in the bay towards the direction the object flew!  A little while before my Friend and I went out to use the laser we were smoking a cigarette and My Girlfriend, My Friend and I saw two aircraft that looked like helicopters with a droning sound. They had red and green and white lights on them like a normal aircraft but were flashing differently.I know the red and green lights are used to determine which direction an aircraft is flying so other aircraft don&rsquo;t hit them. But these red and green lights were alternating and the white light stayed with them. We thought nothing too unusual of these at the time.Many thanks for taking the time to read this report",

The objects were obviously many miles away, most estimates are that the objects had to have been in Huntsville and very likely above the Redstone Arsenal.Entire families and friends would gather on the back porch to watch the UFOs move in wildly varying &quot;formations&quot; if that term fits.  They would move up and down, circle one another, zoom back and forth, and generally each sighting event ended with the lights either disappearing or zooming directly up and out of the atmosphere.The individuals who observed the UFOs varied from a preacher, to housewives, to a retired WWII-Korea-Vietnam combat veteran (101st Airborne, winner of the Silver Star, etc.), and several then-enlisted Army and National Guard members.  These individuals were all very serious people who did not care for watching science fiction films, reading about UFOs, or even speculating about life on other planets.

20100124,20100124," Tampa, FL", circle,5-6 minutes,"Multi-colored illuminated circular object hovers near and crosses over busy interstate highway.I was traveling southbound on interstate 275 at 17:40 hours to go to a dinner party in St. Petersburg, when I saw 2-3 large and rapid flashes of light that covered the general vicinity of my location. I could not pinpoint the direction of flashes. At first I thought it may be lightening, but I had my moonroof open and I noticed that the cloud cover was broken and scattered at the time and there were no thunderstorms in the area. I thought this was odd, but I quickly disregarded it.The traffic flow on the interstate began banking to the right and heading in a west bound direction. After about 1.5 miles of going westbound, I noticed what appeared to be a commercial jet making a landing approach from over the bay waters, with landing lights. It made its approach over the shoreline in the general area of Bayshore and Hyde Park.  However, I then noticed that it seemed to be taking a long time for this jet to make its approach. I then slowed down and the lights seemed to be at a standstill and hovering  just short of the opposite lanes of the interstate expressway at about 300-feet in altitude and a quarter mile downrange from me. At about this time I then realized that what appeared to be landing lights took on a  rapid &ldquo;twinkling&rdquo; appearance as I closed distance on it. I then reduced my speed even more to get a better look and as I did, it went from a hovering standstill and then quickly &ldquo;scooted&rdquo; across all 8 lanes of I-275 in a matter of just a few seco! nds. As the object crossed over the interstate directly in front of me and all oncoming traffic, I then noticed that the entire middle of the object from end to end was illuminated in what seemed to be a grid of yellow, green and blue lights in a rotating pattern.  At this point, I thought It might be a blimp, but as I drove past it, to my dismay, I could clearly see that the lights were rotating around the circumference of a circle. There was no noise or any other anomalies.After it quickly &ldquo;scooted&rdquo; across the interstate it then stopped and hovered over an older and darker section of the city with few street lamps and when it did, the colors became very vivid and seemed to pop out visually and become brighter as they rotated rapidly around its circumference. I also noticed that rotational speed of the lights seemed to have varied becoming faster after it passed over my direction on the interstate.  As the object hovered in darkness, it then became apparent to me that this thing was big. I cannot even estimate a size in feet, but visually, It was the size of a nickel held at arms length in your hand.  As I was attempting to make a phone call to my spouse to tell her about what I saw (She has also seen lights of this description in the past), I looked over twice to see if it was still there and it did not move after it crossed the interstate.  Based on the rotation of vivid multicolored lights around its circumference and its ability hover, then! quickly pick up speed and have no noise, I am confident that this was not a regular aircraft.  I am at a loss to figure what it was and I am not sure if the flashes of light I had seen a couple of minutes earlier were linked to what I saw.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

The time was about 7PM.  I walked outside of my gatehouse and was looking west toward the ocean.  Its a very clear night with unlimited visibility.

It had a little kind of comet tail that was the same color as the light behind it that I could see as it moved closer and passed over my head going south.  It moved from north to south like it was flying down the Florida coast but at 50-100k feet.  It was moving a lot faster then the other jets and had no flashing lights of any kind.  It took maybe 45 seconds to a minute for the light to disappear over the South horizon.  It looked like a star floating across the sky.  Perfectly round amber light.  I thought it was a jet until it passed over my head going south and it was just as bright as it was coming at me.   Like the headlights of a 737 coming at you but when its going away.?  Jets don&apos;t use landing lights on at cruise altitude?  The object appeared to be very high and was moving quicker then the other jets that I could see and pick out in the sky.

This is the second sighting of these simular shaped objects.My son and i sometimes ride out of Danville about 20 miles to the dryfork area near chatham va. We have family there who has one of the largest areas of untouched forested land, the largest wooded area on the map. We were in that location in a secluded area in a second cleared field for farming tobbacco and wheat.We some times go there at night to look up at the stars and have father son talks and to just enjoy the silence and sounds of nature.While we were sitting there in my pickup truck i saw another oval shaped object appear in the sky above the tree top area in the sky, this object immediately streaked accross the sky in a straight line and vanished.My son was not looking in the direction i was at that moment and he missed seeing this object,i immediately told him about it and i had t! old him about the object i saw over Dan River Mills the week before.About 2 minutes later another object of the same shape,color,and appearence suddenly appeared in the exact same location as the first one. This time my son and i both were looking right at this object, and this object also took off with enormous speed and streaked accross the night sky. My son had never seen anything like this before and became very frightened to the point of panic and he wanted to leave the area.I calmed him down by talking to him and proceeded to stay there about another 30 minutes and then we left.These objects were the same shape,color,and size as the one i saw over the mill.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

He thought it was a light tower, but my other friend who&apos;s house we had just left said &quot;there are no light towers around here&quot;. Right after he said that we spotted another one. They seemed to be stationary in the sky. We stopped on a bridge over a creek to get a better look when all of a sudden they started to move. Next more of them, one by one, started to appear seemingly from the creek. Three of them formed a perfect triangle and then a perfectly straight line(stopping for a few seconds each time). We sat on the bridge for about 10 minutes and saw about 15 or 20 orbs floating/dancing oddly but gracefully through the sky. As I stared at them individually I could not tell exactly how close or far away they where, or what was making them glow. When we started driving away I kept looking back and saw them spanning the whole s! kyline behind us. Regretfully none of us got any pictures or videos. But I found pictures and video online from some sightings in the UK that looks exactly like what we saw. That was probably the craziest thing I have ever experienced.

I got a good look at the lights on the craft and they did not resemble at all the lights on a jet; the lights were two solid red non blinking circles.I call the South Kingstown police as I did the previous night, spoke with the officer/dispatcher who took my call seriously.  I told him that the craft resembled UFOs and not jets by the lighting pattern on them.  The second craft was only briefly seen as a red light and was to the north of the closer craft, which was almost directly over my house.  The dispatcher said he would call the state police to see what they knew.I didn&apos;t hear any more about it until the next night while watching the evening news at my mother&apos;s house some 30 miles away.   Apparently many calls came in to the news station (either WJAR-TV or WPRO-TV, both in Providence, as I can&apos;t remember which station I had on).  The TV reported said the &apos;mystery jets&apos; were training runs by jets based on &quot;Cape Cod.&quot;   He did not say where.  There is only one air base on Cape Cod, in Massachusetts, and that is at Otis Air Base in Mashpee.  They were quick with the report and merely flashed to an archive photo of jets lined up and they were not the &quot;F-16s&quot; that the news station mentioned as coming from Cape Cod.

This is one of five of my sightings and the most spectacular one out of the five.My friend and myself were heating and air installation employees who worked for Climate Control out of south boston at the time this took place. We were working on the sears building roof top,installing the last flue pipe on the job site that day.The sky was completely clear blue sky, no clouds anywhere, perfect visability! We had just picted up  our tool belts and heading towards the roof top stair door, i noticed a craft that i had mistaken for a small airplane at a glance in the distance that had hovered around the old Dan River Mills smoke stacks located closest to the worsham st. bridge area, down in that direction.After catching my attention i noticed that the craft was moving in our direction, straight at us. The moment that i realized this object was not an airplane was when it began to turn on its side at a 90 degree angle with no drop in altitude and not in a turn such as an aircraft would do.The object turned 90 degrees on its side and then it turned back to a level position as it was moving towards us on the roof top of the sears building, and keep in mind, this object was just a little bit higher than we were at eye level.Once the object returned to a horizontal position it was close enough to be fully visable with much detail.Once the craft leveled ot to a horizontal position i yelled out to my work mate and i pointed str! aight at it in total shock and disbelief. At that moment the craft turned upwards on its side at a 45 degree angle and shot across the sky at a speed so fast that the object became a streak of white light accross the sky, and there was a noticeable point of exit at the end of the streak of white light. Where the object streak ended in the sky there was something like white stars of light that shot back towards the direction of the streak of white light.Also this streak of light was not a vapor trail it was a split second exit, aweome and unbelievable.The craft was a disk shaped object with small areas on the top side like dark rectangular shaped indentations and the same on the bottom side of the craft as well.The object was a beautiful gold color like the sun and the classic disk shape like in the old ufo movies.The object had an appearence of a somewhat dulling effect of the light around the object but plainly visable.

As it came from the east, it circled over my house then proceeded easterly again; as it did the lights flashed to all white, then back to all red non blinking.  I could only guess at the full shape of the craft, which appeared chevron-shaped.  It headed east over the town of Narragansett and I could still hear its roar.  I also saw a small white circular light accompanying the craft for a brief time as it headed east.  The craft then veered away from the paralleling white orb.

I went outside to see a low flying jet of either the F-14 or F-16 shape.  Oddly, however, as it banked by raising one wing I saw absolutely no markings of any kind on the totally gun-metal grey plane.  Oddly, too, there was a smaller Cessna-like one engine plane flying very close to the &apos;jet.&apos;   At this time another witness, an TV/internet installer at my house came outside and I pointed up at the craft.  He looked at it and thought it was a F-14 as he was familiar with some jet craft.  He, too, thought it odd that the &apos;jet&apos; had no markings on it and that he thought the smaller plane was flying with the jet somehow.  The &apos;jet&apos; flew in the exact same pattern as the night observations I made, coming from the east, flying around my house in a low flight pattern, then heading back east again over the  town of Narragansett and out to sea.  I called the South Kingstown police again.  I reported what I had seen and the dispatcher said, &apos;one minute please&apos; as he went away for 3 or 4 minuted before coming back to talk to me to report that all he knew was that he was told by someone that the &apos;jets&apos; came from an air base on Cape Cod somewhere and he said that was the official explanation.  I thanked him for taking my call.  I then called the Air National Guard at Quonset Pt. in North Kingstown to see what they knew.  I could not  get to talk to anyone as I had on the morning of the 22nd, Friday, where a Sergeant with the Air National Guard told me there were no jets reported to him and none were at the Quonset location (only C-130s and helicopters).  He said that Air Defense in Providence would have picked them up on radar anyway.  He also said that he was at home in Narragansett the night before and had in fact heard but not seen the &apos;jets.&apos;  I also this morning called Senator Reed of Rhode Island&apos;s office to see if they knew anything about these flights.  A woman who answered the phone knew nothing but took my name and phone number and said she or someone would call me back but I have not heard from the Senator&apos;s office the rest of today.

20100127,20100127," Fort Collins, CO", light,8 min,"Very Bright in due West, Hovered about 2 min&apos;s, then accelerated very fast stright up.Driving due west toward the mountains, approaching north HWY 287 in Fort Collins, I saw a very bright light between 18 to 20 degrees west above the mountains.  At first I dismissed this as a planet, as it looked as if it was stationary.  The time was about 6:48am and in Fort Collins, this is during Civil Twilight where the sun is 6 degrees or less below the horizon. (Sun rise is at 7:08am).  I was about to dismiss this object and turn north to go home, when I had to stop at a red light.  I lined up three points using my Bronco, a tree for line of sight, just to make sure that the object was not moving.  I watched it hover for about 10 or 15 seconds, when I noticed that it was indeed moving very slowly.  At first, I thought that this was my imagination, but the object started to accelerate, and I knew it was not a planet.  When the light turned green, I did not turn north, but went through the intersection and pulled over as fast as I could.  I got out of my Bronco, and watched for about 30 seconds.  The object moved about 1/3 the distance it was from the ground in about 4 seconds.  It accelerated very quickly, and then disappeared.  Still assuming that this might be a Jet that was reflecting the sun light, and possibly approaching my line of sight until it turned, which would look as if it were hovering, and then accelerating, I went home and crunched the numbers.  This is what I got:  The altitudes of most commercial jets are about 30,000 feet.  If the object was 18 to 20 degrees from my line of sight, that would make it 16.61 to 18.32 miles away from me.  I went to Fort Collins airport, and found the visibility for 7:00am, and it was 10 miles.  This indicated that the object was close to double the distance for visibility.  With the sun hitting an object, one might still be able to see it, so I calculated the speed. It the object moved 1/3 its altitude in 4 seconds, then it would be traveling close to 2400 feet per second, (rounding off).  This equates to 1630 mph, which commercial jet cannot do.  My conclusions suggest that unless this was a military craft that was reflecting the sun and traveling directly into my line of sight, (which made it look like it was hovering for over two minutes), and then shot straight up at a climbing rate of 1630 mph, then it is something unique.  Lastly, if the object was indeed moving at a velocity of 1630 mph, and was coming directly at me for over two minutes, then it would have covered a distance of 54 miles, which would have brought the craft over my head in less than 60 seconds, which it did not do.  I would be interested if anyone else saw this object from another direction so I can get better numbers.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

We were then looking upwards towards the Eastern sky when 3 dim but distinct white lights forming an equilateral triangle flew overhead at high speed on about an 80 degree Easterly heading.   No outline of a craft was visible.The lights each had appearances more like that of illuminated rings rather than being solid, and the intensity of each ring was about that of a medium star that is easily observable.   If there had been street or yard lights nearby, they probably would not have been visible.  I definitely feel that they were all on one craft of some sort as they did not vary in distance or orientation to each other at all.  As for the size, the palm of your hand would have covered them all with your arm extended.  The diameter of each ring was approximately 25% of each leg of the triangle.  They had already passed overhead when we spotted them at about 75 degrees above the Eastern! horizon.  I&rsquo;d estimate that they traveled 30 to 35 degrees of the sky in 3 to 4 seconds before we lost sight behind the trees and roof.  The wind was calm and we heard absolutely no sound.   This craft had just went out of sight, when we spotted a single ring of light of the same magnitude and speed following a parallel path slightly to the south.  It may have been slightly larger than the other rings.  Or lower?   My initial gut feeling was that these lights were traveling at an altitude in excess of 10,000 feet with a speed in the thousands of miles per hour.  I have no way to know what the actual altitude was, but they did not appear to get smaller or less brilliant as they passed, so that indicates to me that they were of significantly high altitude.What appeared to be an airliner was almost directly overhead shortly after the rings and the lights on it were much brighter and the speed was slower by many many times.  The temperature was 12 degrees and the stars were bright and crisp, so even thought they were dim, the rings of light were very distinct and stayed at the same intensity for the brief time they were visible.Added 1/27/10:  My date read the above and agreed on everything other than she said she thought the rings were visible at least 4 seconds.

The object was between 150-250 ft across, from tip to midpoint of opposite edge.I exited the freeway and made two rights to head north again.  I phoned home and told my girlfriend what happened.  I tried to catch up to the object but with recent rain and poor quality of roads as well as obeying traffic laws I could not get underneath it again.  Eventually I pulled over and watch it float northward directly over the base and continue going.Background of witness: &bull;",

After a few seconds she managed to get a small look at it, before her eyes gave way and got teary, making her look away and loose sight of the object.

I got the binoculars to look and this large white center light had pulsing green and red lights the whole way around it. It was just above the tree line on the horizon.

However, when we got out on the deck, beyond the roof, we saw it again about 10-15 degrees higher in the sky, still not moving, just staying still.  It started to move fast toward  our house. When it got close we could briefly hear a humming noise. When I could no longer see it from the deck I ran inside and out the front door. Just that quickly it was completely gone. We live in the country with no outside lights so the sky is dark and visible from one horizon to the next.The red and green lights were not airplane lights as we see those fairly often.  These lights totally surrounds the bright circle of light and were all flashing.The picture that I took shows groups of lights that look like they are hooked together with lines. The numerous lights, although not colored, are fairly accurate. The lines, I think, are from my not holding the camera completely still.

At the base of the Oakland Hills, myself as well as three other friends, were on the outdoor deck of a penthouse on the fourth floor of an apartment building. Our focus was on the horizon just over the hills due to the reason that a friend mentioned that the moon rises so quickly at night over the hill. While we were waiting as we observed the glow of the moon thru the fog rolling over the hill, two of the three friends went into the house (the residents of the apartment.) I remained outside because at 25 years of age I had never witnessed the moonrise before. While the other and myself were anxiously waiting for the moon to peak over the hill he shouted, &ldquo; A UFO, a UFO!!!&rdquo; I immediately looked to where he was pointing and I saw a triangle shaped object. It was three translucent reddish-colored orbs in a symmetrical &ldquo;pyramid&rdquo; shape. The top! of the triangle, the point, was at the head of the direction it was moving. It was moving at a higher rate of speed at an altitude higher than that of planes that regularly fly over the same area. Its rate of speed during the sighting never wavered. It remained at a constant speed throughout the sighting. At the time it was in our field of view, there was not one other plane or object in the sky. The only things in the sky in view were the stars. When he shouted, the male resident of the apartment raced out to the deck (back patio) and immediately saw the UFO. He was the only one who said he &ldquo;heard&rdquo; it. Myself as well as the other fellow who first observed the object did not hear anything. It was just &ldquo;gliding&rdquo; thru the sky. I have never seen anything like it.It was funny or odd to me that several minutes after the sighting, as we were all in amazement of what we had just observed, I noticed the sky began to fill up with airplanes flying overhead. This was odd to me due to the fact that when the UFO was in the sky there were no other objects present except the sky and stars.

The lights were small, much like backup lights on a car, so we just thought that it was her landlords working on a farm truck.  We sat by the mailbox and waited a minute or so for them to come out of the road.  When after a few minutes, the lights were still there, I pulled my car up closer to the lights.  As we approached them, they backed up into the hayfield.  I had my car window rolled down to listen, as the neighbors entrance, the first on the road  is where the lights were first-on the ground and their dogs were barking and crying and howling!   We didn&rsquo;t hear any motor noises from the &ldquo;farm truck&rdquo; and wondered why it backed all the way to the back of the hayfield!   Then the two lights got bigger and brighter, though there was no beam.  As ! soon as we saw them rise up into the air, we knew it wasn&rsquo;t our friends in any farm truck.  I speed up to catch up and the faster I went, the fast it went.  The , bigger now, lights went up and over the fence of the hayfield, across the farmers road, across the fence to the cow pasture and went along about 15 feet above the ground.  I was speeding at this point, faster than I would have ever driven down the road , maybe 25 mph, but couldn&rsquo;t catch up.

We had both  front windows  of the car open by now and can verify that there was not a single sound  of any motor or of any power plant within the UFO.  And again, there was no beam of light coming in our direction or any other.  The lights were just there!  We found out the next day that our friend, the landlady of the farm had seen the lights when she came home, about 30 minutes before we did.  She saw it in the area, above the river, behind the house in about the same location that we had last seen it.

No one seen this but me, I called my friend who live a few blocks up and she had no idea what I was talking about. No one was outside, no one heard it, it was almost like it was only meant for me to see it. Like it camouflaged it&rsquo;s self to everyone in the world but me. When my parents got home I tried to tell them, I grabbed 2 paper plates placed them together, covered them with tin foil and tried to draw the piping.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

When I returned into the kitchen, I heard the motor from the spa in my backyard turn on.  It does this automatically and I am used to this.  The inside of the house was quiet;  I did not have any appliances on.  The time was around 7:15 pm.Immediately after noticing the spa turn on, I heard a louder, unrecognizable noise that seemed to drown out the otherwise noisy spa motor.  I was curious and mildly alarmed by the unfamiliar noise.  Puzzled after a few seconds and the noise still continuing, I stopped what I was doing (replacing the liner on the kitchen trash can) and opened the patio door a few inches and paused.  I confirmed the noise was from outside.  I quickly stepped outside, and when I was about four-five feet from the house, looking in the direction of the noise, I saw an unidentified object flying low in the sky, above the row of house on my side of the street, moving above the homes along Crisp Avenue, then Klein Avenue toward Flagship.I am familiar with how helicopters sound as I used to have a neighbor who owned one and flew it regularly from his home across the street from me.  I was also an EMT and know the sound of helicopters up close as I have loaded patients onto medevac copters.    This object did not sound like a helicopter.  It was too slow to be a plane.  It was hard to determine its shape but it appeared to have at least four lights at opposite points, at/near the craft&rsquo;s outer perimeter.  The shape of the craft had a ring or circular silhouette.  As it moved in a northerly direction away from me, it stayed very low to the houses and within a few seconds was out of my sight.I ran inside to get my iphone the only camera I have - that was in my workbag in my upstairs office.  Hoping to see it and photograph it, I ran downstairs with my iphone, out the front door and out onto the street.  I did not see it, nor could I detect the sound anymore.  I ran back inside and upstairs again, this time to retrieve my wallet.  I jumped into my car and started driving slowly on the streets of Mare Island with the top of my convertible down.  I pulled over to park, look and listen.   Wanting to share my experience, I telephoned my brother&rsquo;s home, first speaking with my sister-in-law who is a middle school teacher, then with my brother who is a retired police officer like me.  I am 52 years old and of sound mind.  I have never seen a UFO before tonight.",

First, there was no noice and that made me stare at the object when approaching and Second, as the object approached, what I thought therewere lights, might have been the bright of the top part of the object, therewere no flushing lights or so the third thing is that as the object cleared my location and I could saw completally the underneat shape (oval and spiral)and it was not bright, like from a different material, the color was dark could be easily disgazed and camuflated in the clouds, as if purposely it had been colored to disguised in the dark clouds.

The object first appeared to be glowing, but after a closer look, it seemed to be aflame.It did not appear to be moving quickly, and I did not see it leaving a &lsquo;trail&rsquo;.  I thought that it was an emergency flare, but I think that a flare is more of a &lsquo;glow&rsquo; than a &lsquo;flame&rsquo;, and this looked more like a flame.The object seemed to be about 60 degrees up from the horizon when I first spotted it, and directly ahead of me (90 degrees) when I lost sight of it (or at the point it &lsquo;flamed out&rsquo;).  I hope that I am using the right terminology here.It seemed to have lost some elevation as it moved away from me, but without knowing the altitude of the object, there is no way to know how much elevation was lost.The object either &lsquo;flamed out&rsquo; or moved behind clouds at approximately 8:09 pm.After arriving home, I called 911, but they had received no other reports of the object.",

We decided to try and get closer for a better look but since it was dark our phone cameras were insufficient for pictures. We witnessed the object(s) a few more times, each time rerouting our course adjusting for the change in position of the object. Finally we gave up the chase after seeing no other signs of the object for over ten minutes. Also, its important to note that as one light would go out another would appear. Sometimes the string would get to be three or four lights in a diagonal upward row. I have witnessed this before, but my last encounter I owned a radar detector. Each time that the lights would appear, my radar detector would go off as if someone had just shot me with a radar gun. Full blast. I no longer have the detector however, as it broke a few months ago. I am a full-time college student/sophomore to the College of Southern Idaho and manage a restaurant in Jerome ID.",

The &quot;UFO&quot; was triangular in shape with somewhere between 40-60 lights on the underside of it all with the same brightness and standard yellowish color. I stopped on the side of the road, got out of the car and starred at the object for at least a minute, watching it hover around over the tree tops. I tried as hard as possible to absorb as much info as I could about this object because it would be so hard to tell someone what I saw later on. I was able to conclude that if it was on the ground it would have been about 10-15ft across with about 50 lights tightly packed together taking up the entire area of the underside of the object. The lights stayed on as rows consecutively turned off and then back on as th! e next row did. After about 15 seconds some of the lights turned off to create an arrow shape on the underside of the object with the rows turning on and off the same way; the arrow was pointing in the direction it was moving. The object made no sound whatsoever and made erratic movements back and forth on either side of the road going only a few miles per hour as if the wind was pushing it along back and forth. After staring at it for a minute the object started going down the street in the direction I was heading. I immediately got back into the car and started chasing after it. I never lost sight of it while chasing it and it started going faster than I could keep up with it. I looked at the speedometer and I was going in excess of 60 MPH and still accelerating for another quarter mile until the road came to an intersection where the road i was on ended and the object continued straight in the direction it was going over the tree line due east. I could not get a photo be! cause it was dark and the quality of my camera phone was poor.! The wea ther was clear and it was at 7:00 pm so it was dark. About my self, I have never believed in UFO&apos;s and I never had an interest in it before in fact I would laugh about it when people on tv claimed they saw something. I was going from my house to my job as a firefighter so there was no drug/alcohol involved. I am currently a college student. This is the first time I have ever seen something like this and have done research to see if this was a military object and could not find anything close to what I saw except for other similar triangular UFO&apos;s but they usually only have three lights as opposed to my blinking 50 or so lights.",

20100203,20100203," Ponca City, OK", triangle,10 mins,"night sighting of large triangle objectAround July in 1999, my family and I were camping at kaw lake just outside of Ponca City.  It was late at night, my best guess would be around ten p.m.  My family was sitting around the campfire and I walked out to look at the lake.  Across the lake directly West of where I was standing on the opposite bank were three lights that formed a triangle.  The triangle it formed was huge and originally I though that it was merely the intersecting  of three tower lights, perhaps from the plant that is in Ponca City or from oil rigs.  As I continued looking at it, however, I noticed that it was moving.  It was moving very very slowly and was very close to the ground.  Since I knew it was moving I started to consider maybe it was three military airplanes flying together in formation and I was looking at their front lights.  That didn&rsquo;t match up either though because as low as it was there is no aircraft that I know of that could fly that slow.  Also, I ruled out that it was three separate aircrafts because the lights started to turn off one at a time.  One would turn off and then come back on, another might flicker and go off and then come back.  I watched it for about 5-10mins and then left.  I have never really believed in aliens and what I saw intrigued me but that&rsquo;s about it.  It was just recently that I saw a show on flying triangle ufos and was shocked that the footage that was shown on that show was the same thing I had seen over the lake years ago.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

She says that it is very difficult to explain and that she had never seen anything like it before. She described the bottom to look something like a brain with texture and the colors mixing together. The whole bottomed had a yellowish pink/peachy/ amber glow. She said the bottom seemed to smooth directly in the rest of the metal above the craft. The metalish material looked like grayish black pewter. She describes the bottom as if you could put your hand through a light pink wettish layer but then it would be stopped by a hard layer where the lights seemed to be coming from.She was shocked and then paused for second in her bed and the ran to the bathroom window in the back of our house to see if she could still see it. She seen it just as it was moving over the trees in our back yard.... she said it was gliding right above the trees and moving at a steady slow pace like it was observing something. The craft then faded in the distance beyond the trees. I asked her if it was spinning and she said no. The most remarkable thing to her was the bottom of the craft...she described it a beautiful...but very strange...jello like but firm. According to her the craft was the size of 4 cars put in a circle.She tends to not believe in these sort of things and is very sincere...therefore I am reporting this because I truely beleive her and it was such a detailed, close sighting. I had her draw a picture. The craft headed toward the wooded area behind our house which has more than 165 acreas of wooded land.",

My wife and I were at home in Spokane, listening to our Police scanner when we suddenly heard frantic reports of a large orange colored light hovering over fairchild Airforce Base. Many Deputy Sheriffs on patrol observed the &quot;sphere of light&quot; and were discussing it on the police radio. From where we live, we could hear jets being put in the air with the unmistakable sound of after burners propelling them. Not long after the radio traffic concerning this light began, a deputy reported that the craft was moving off in a south easterly direction and soon afterwards, the shift supervisor for dispatch ordered talk of this incident silenced and they must have switched over to a tac frequency as we heard nothing more about it on the scanner.We fully expected this incident to be on the local news or in the local paper, but found no report had been made public,at least to our knowledge! I am not certain of the year, it may have been earlier or later by a year or two. I would love to find out what went on with this thing!

I find myself in a very desolate part of New Mexico on Highway 60 heading east.  I am on the road so early because I couldn&apos;t sleep, I am sure with anticipation of the very long drive to Denver ahead of me.  I have driven up to Eager Arizona to see a friend, stay the night and head out the following day.  It was suggested to take 60 because it&apos;s a much prettier drive than Interstate 40.  I had done that so many times, I could drive that in my sleep, a new route was in order.  However, because it was so very dark, I didn&apos;t see much.  The occasional fog patch and lone vehicle heading in the opposite direction.  I could see silouettes of the landscape and there was snow on the ground that dimly luminated my surroundings.  I was awake.  Very awake.  Just finished a large cup of coffee, listening to Sirius stand-up comedy (satellite radio) and driving very fast 75-85 mph.  I was alone on this road.Judging from some of the signs I had passed, I thought I was coming up on a small town and slowed down a bit.  I started to gain on a mini van and decided to hold back and not pass until we went through the town.  Being the kind of driver I am, I am constantly looking at my surroundings.  Both side mirrors, rear view mirror and of course, straight ahead.  Not coming up on any town and I start to think about passing the van.  I look in my driver side mirror and there is suddenly a vehicle directly behind me, only more toward the center of the two lane highway than in my lane.  As if it were thinking about passing me.  I&apos;m thinking, what the...I did not see anything in the distance, had not gone around any curves, nothing obscured my view of several miles behind or in front of me.  I did not pass any roads either for somebody to get on to the highway.  My first impression other than how freakishly close it was to my tailgate, was that is was the grill of an older model 80&apos;s, boxy Chevy truck.  I never saw a truck, just what I have illustrated on my drawing.  It was directly, 3 - 4 FEET behind me.  We are traveling at maybe 75 mph. .. I&apos;m thinking, pass me buddy.  I look in my rearview, see only the lights (not all of them), side view, looks like it wants to go around.  I move to the right to indicate he is cleared for passing. Look again, it&apos;s right on me, look forward to make sure I am not too close to the van which is at a very safe distance, then look back to see where it is.  It vanished.  I even slowed down to look behind me to see where it went, no dust from going off the road, we did not pass a road to turn (going to fast and it was far too close to me to make a sudden turn), there were no ditches, no tail lights behind...nothing.  Just gone.At the time, I wasn&apos;t thinking UFO, but I thought the grill was odd and the lights weren&apos;t the average color or placement. Why didn&apos;t I see the shape of  the truck I thought it was?  Why were the main headlights a soft orange and why was there more than one turn signal light? Honestly, I did not see the whole thing, just what I could see in my drivers side mirror at a very close range.  There is no way it could have come up so fast without me seeing it.  I was going very fast and was on the lookout..(I didn&apos;t want a ticket for speeding).After it was gone, my mirror was really dirty, foggy, I rolled the window down and tried to wipe it clean. It wouldn&apos;t clean up, just smear. AND, I felt a tremendous need to sleep. I could not keep my eyes open.  I rolled the windows down, thinking the cold air would keep me awake until the sun came up.  Didn&apos;t help so much.  I fought it and finally came upon a very small town just as the sun started to come up.  I pulled over, where there were several buildings and some activity and gathered my thoughts.  At first, I thought maybe it was a ghost truck, don&apos;t laugh.  I did think that.  Then as I drove on it occurred to me Roswell was just over the mountain range...really??  could it be??  It all really struck me as bizarre, the way it happened. The rate of speed, how it suddenly appeared, how close it was to my truck and the way the &quot;truck grill&quot; looked, not quite right..and, how it suddenly vanished.Do I report this?  If so, to who?  As I showered, I checked for any weird marks..you just never know.",
20100204,20100204," Westminster, CA", disk,5 minutes,"There were two ships, saucer shaped, silver grey..like pewter, soundless, drifting over our neighborhood like silent boats on the waterMy mother and I were returning from grocery shopping one evening.  It wasn&apos;t too late, being a school night.  From a distance, my mother and I thought that it was a blimp preparing for an emergency landing.  When we drove closer, we realized it was actually two ships.  They were larger than cars, maybe 15 or 20 feet radius.  They looked like what you would see in a Hollywood movie: disk-like or saucer shaped.  The center seemed more spherical.  They reminded me of pewter or stainless steel - a dull shine.  There were lights going around the outer edge, although now, we can not agree on the color.  The lights did not shine down on anything.  I didn&apos;t see any seams, doors or windows.  I remember getting out of the car and thinking that it was all true...all the reports that had been made at that time of sightings in our city. The two ships were just above the two-story homes in the neighborhood.  They made no sound.  I remember only hearing the strange buzz of our street lamp.  It seemed like one ship was following the other, just above our street, just above roof level.  At first, I got the impression that they were trying to hide from us...they went down one street, them came back into our view...maybe they knew we saw them and came for a closer look at us.  I had run into the house and got my father, then the three of us were now out standing on our front lawn with our dog. The two ships slowly rotated, or maybe the lights were revolving around their perimeter. I took a step forward, thinking I would be one of the first humans to meet these visitors...but my father said, &quot;Stay right where you are.&quot;  And being only 13, I did.  I wasn&apos;t afraid, but the tone in my father&apos;s voice scared me. We watched as the ships slowly went down the street, one following the other.  They were over the elementary school I had attended, and for a moment I thought that perhaps they would land there.  But the leader seemed to move forward - like a slight pull or jerk - and then shot off to the right with a streak! of white light.  The the second one did the same thing.  They were gone.  We went into the house with our groceries, and I wanted to call the newspaper, or maybe the police...My mother looked very concerned and my father just said no.  He didn&apos;t want anyone to think that we were a bunch of nuts.  The next day, at school, I told my science teacher what I had seen.  He listened respectfully, since I wasn&apos;t the type of kid to be speaking up and never known to lie.  After a few minutes I kept asking him what could fly like that, without sound or air movement or anything...just gliding along like a boat on water.  Of course he said there wasn&apos;t anything and then I could tell he didn&apos;t believe me and some of my friends were looking at me kind of funny....so, I knew what my father meant...&quot;Some kind of nut.&quot;  But it really happened and it certainly peaked my interest in science, especially astronomy. I now teach Math and Science courses at the high school level.  I tell my story to my students....but only on Halloween and April Fool&apos;s Day....after all, I don&apos;t want them or my principal thinking I&apos;m some kind of nut.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

The lights blinked in unison and then separately approximately 2 seconds apart.  They looked to be about 15 feet off the ground and about 50 feet apart.  As we approached the dirt road were they had been hovering, we stopped because the lights were suddenly gone.  The road is a dirt road which intersects our main county road and connects to the next parallel county road 5 miles away.  We looked down the road for any sign of vehicles, head lights or anything that would have explained the lights.  The dirt road has a small power substation adjacent to the beginning of the road which would explain our theory of a power company line truck being parked on the road.  The power tends to go off periodically in our area due to normal winter wind and snow storms so seeing! a line truck is not unusual.  We never saw any other vehicles, so we proceeded towards home again driving approximately 25 miles per hour so we could scan the horizon.  This road is on the west side of a very large alpine valley in Northern California and the line of sight available across the valley at any given time is vast.  The only time vision is obscured is when there is a white-out snow storm or too much fog.  Neither were happening at the time, only a light drizzle of sporadic rain.  After traveling one more mile the lights suddenly reappeared in the same fashion, approximately 20 feet off the ground now, still blinking bright orange and 50 feet from each other.  The lights were in an area well known by both my daughter and I since we have lived across from this particular field for 11 years.  There are no roads and no homes on this land, only alfalfa fields which had approximately 2 feet of snow covering the field at the time.  We drove slowly on the road never ta! king our eyes off the lights and as we approached our road the! lights appeared to have slowly moved away from us in a southerly direction, yet they were still blinking in the same fashion and just as bright.  We stopped on the road right before turning onto our dirt road and watched the lights for a few minutes.  They stopped moving away but continued to blink in a random fashion, sometimes in unison, then separately.  The distance apart never changed and was very steady.  The height of each light was exactly the same.  We didn&apos;t feel anything unusual and we didn&apos;t hear anything unusual.  It was very dark outside so we weren&apos;t able to see if there was any sort of aircraft or shape around the lights.  After we drove up our road we looked back down over the valley and the lights were gone.

I then saw another to the right, higher and farther away. The first one was close enough to make out the shape and colors of it quite clearly: A distinct triangle of blue, red, green and yellow lights.It looked very much like a Christmas decoration, and if it were in a position to possibly be atop something I wouldn&rsquo;t have questioned it. But when I saw the other, higher and farther away, also stationary, I was baffled.I went around to the front of our house to get a better angle above the tree tops and saw, to the west, two more triangles.  These were dancing in the air. Flitting about. Then they sped off.I went back to the back yard and the two triangles were still there but each higher in the sky and farther away.  So, not stationary, but I was unable to see them move because it was so gradual.  One hour later the two in the back were still visible but much farther away and higher in the sky.We live near an air force base and have witnessed Harrier jets come to complete stops in mid air.  I would love to have that be the answer.  I just question why they would be lit up like Christmas trees and stay floating high in the sky for hours.   Also the triangles were always facing me so if they were on the wings and the nose of a plane it would have to have spent all its time on its side to give that view.",

We were on Mercury Blvd. on the East side of the EAFB dry lake bed. Think Space Shuttle landing strip runway that runs West to East in front of the notorious &ldquo;South Base&rdquo; Birk Flight Test Center.  We noticed a very large black triangle shaped craft coming off the runway and slowly gaining altitude.  We pulled over in time to have it come directly over our heads.  It appeared to be quite &ldquo;thick&rdquo; almost as though it were a balloon with somewhat puffy panels on its sides.  Underneath were very bright lights that reminded me of recessed counter top lighting.  Once it passed us it gained altitude VERY RAPIDLY and it blended in with stars above and was no longer visible.  It was way cool indeed.  We were speechless for a bit and felt very lucky to have seen it. Our thoughts were that the lights somehow adjusted to the star patterns above and also adjusted for altitude for viewing angles.  It was completely silent.  Obviously we assumed this was a re-con craft because we watched it carefully and lost it not to be found again.  We are talking seconds here.  It was definitely not an alien craft.

This was approx. 5:15 AM, when I woke up to get something to drink from my throat being too dry. This object I say was for sure not a star, it wasn&apos;t the planet Venus, and it sure wasn&apos;t swamp gas lol. I saw a spherical amberish red light in the sky. This light was stationary and extremely odd looking. It was simply said, a true &quot;fire in the sky.&quot; The light often dimmed and then would come back lit, at times, within a fraction of second, this thing would shine extremely bright. The best way I can describe it was like a superconducting light bulb that just would shutter immense light at a very short period of time. Then, there was a second &amp; third one. Fading in &amp; out.Anyway, after knowing that this was something unnatural, I ran into my bedroom and got out my 8mm camera BUT the battery was dead. So, secondly, I grabbed my digital picture camera and jolted outside. With only having limited disc space and recording time, I started filming. Let me tell you, this object was wild..I was pretty captivated by it..but that would soon change.  Here&rsquo;s a link to the short video I filmed:  http://s67.photobucket.com/albums/h313/euphoria5150/?action=view&amp;current=Dustins_UFO_video_clip.flv  After taping my short video, I watched it, instead of just one bright object, the camera was showing three of them, different colors and dimming on and off.  This blew my mind, right, so I looked back up into the sky and there was only one object. As soon as I did, something happened&hellip;something rather frightening. Just as if, this &quot;thing&apos; could sense what I was doing and where I was at, it plotted a course toward me. Within seconds, this light was getting a lot larger and it was apparent that distance was the factor. Yes, this UFO was coming directly toward me. Now, don&apos;t get me wrong, it didn&rsquo;t make any cool Arial movements or swoop down toward me. It came directly toward me like it was following some GPS flight plan. Best way I can describe it, like seeing a white light at the end of a dark tunnel...just getting larger and larger and larger. Within about eight seconds, this thing was half the size of the moon and still coming directly towards me.Once that light started coming toward me, I totally didn&apos;t feel very &apos;warm&apos; about it. I thought. After that, the object stopped in air again and remained stationary for a while. I ran inside and was peering out the window, the objects were gone.. That&apos;s the kind of fear this thing gave me. Let&apos;s just say, I didn&apos;t get any sleep last night...none at all.  I will be happy to post the video that I took before this thing started coming after me. No, I didn&apos;t take any more video after that, my shaking hands couldn&apos;t even hold up a piece of paper at that point.This was a true story, I&apos;m a Rhodes State College Graduate &amp; I have extensive technical background.

20100209,20100209," Cowley, WY", cylinder,10 min. ??,"Witnessed a cylinder shape object, very close, moving slowly, deep humming sound,  illuminated portals showing mechanical rooms.Event Location: On Farm about 1 mile North of Cowley, Wyoming  I was 27 years old, mother of  three small children.  I was sleeping and began dreaming of an airplane, it was flying closer as the sound grew louder until it flew through the window.  The dream was so real, it startled me fully awake, then slowly coming to the realization the sound was still there.  From our farm looking west, B-52 bombers could frequently be seen flying quite low in a north-south direction.  What I was hearing was consistent with a large group of low flying heavy bombers directly over our house going East to West.I went outside and stood on the steps looking up and to the west.  It was a moonless night and the only lights were the millions of stars seen in the clear Wyoming skies.  I could detect a smooth flying motion overhead moving west, and the sound remained a constant deep droning/humming sound.  I continued to watch still thinking it was a large number of large airplanes, but I was curious why they would be flying in such close formation so late at night and in the middle of nowhere. It was unusual, but thought they must be moving a fleet to the West Coast following the end of the Vietnam War.I wondered how many there were as I could not distinguish individual shapes, so I began looking intently for indications of wings and lights that should be at least on the tips.  I could detect no wings, no lights, no silhouette of a wing shape.  All the while the massive  object continued slowly on its westerly trajectory.  There were no lights either on the craft or in our yard to help illuminate to assist in giving a better indication of size, color, material, shape, and distance.As I continued to watch, a portal came into view.  It was in the underside of the craft and illuminated with a soft florescent light.  Over the years, my memory has become a little fuzzy on whether the color was green or blue, but it was a very pleasing color to the eye, not harsh and I lean to it being a pretty blue florescent.  The light made it easy for me to clearly see inside the portal.What I saw was an immaculate mechanical room.  There was what looked like a large boiler with pipes connected to it.  Everything was the same color, but the shapes were very distinct and familiar.  Very Earthly.  I continued to watch as the portal slowly moved out of sight.  It was interesting that the light was obviously very bright and illuminated a large room, but did not extend outside the craft.  After the portal passed from view, I could no longer detect where the portal was.  There was no glow of light emanating from beneath the craft.  I continued to watch, and after a few moments another portal came into view.  The light was the same and the room&rsquo;s contents appeared to be identical to the first room seen.  Another mechanical room, with an identical &ldquo;boiler&rdquo; and connecting pipes.  Everything I could see appeared identical to the first portal.I continued to watch trying to see any details that might be visible, but it was so dark the shape was determined more by the absence of the stars.  It was long and cylindrical, there were no sharp edges.  I had a clear view to the West for about 15 to 20 miles.  The craft was so close it shut out all of the night sky as I looked north and most of the night sky as I looked west.  It was very low, but not able to determine exactly how low, and traveling very slow, but not able to indicate how slow except that I was able to get a very good look inside the portals.  So, maybe between 5 to 15 MPH.  Again, there was never a change in the sound, it was a continuous deep, humming or droning sound.  I never changed my opinion about it being consistent with large airplanes flying over head.  It was flying level in a true East to West direction.  I never saw the beginning or end of the craft.  What I did see was larger than a football field, but did not see the craft in its entirety. ! There were no unusual odors, no unusual wind movement, and there was no disturbance of animals (cattle, dogs, etc.) that I was aware of.  Everything was silent except the sound indicated.I started to become uneasy, even a little frightened and decided to go back inside.  My children were sleeping and I was just beginning to understand that what I had been watching was very extraordinary and there was nothing in my reference that explained it.  I sat quietly in the living room, did not turn on any lights to look at a clock, and just waited for it to pass. I did not look out the window, I did not want to do anything to bring attention to myself, our home, my family.  I continued to hear the sound for sometime after I went back inside and was relieved when the sound finally ceased.   I do not remember that the sound faded away as planes would as they went into the distance, rather it just stopped and became quiet.  I do not know the total duration, but it was several minutes from the time I first became aware of the sound in a fully conscious state to when it finally ceased.I did not tell anyone about this experience until some years later.   I looked for something that would explain what I had seen in logical terms.  I married a retired Air Force Pilot with thousands of hours flying time and over 4 millions air miles.  We attended many military air shows together, and I would look for anything that resembled what I had seen.    Over the years I never saw anything remotely like what I had seen years earlier.  My husband Bill was the first person related my experience to, followed by my children after they were grown.  I have also since told a couple of my siblings.  I told my brother after he related an experience he and my mother had with light orbs following them on a deserted highway traveling late one night in Wyoming.This is the experience I had as I remember it and choosing to report it officially while the details are clear.  It occurred on a moonless summer night, approximately 27 July 1976, probably after midnight.   I am positive of the year, the month was most likely July, but may have also been June.  My young brother was in the hospital in Billings Montana when this occurred.  The window of possibility is indicated below.New Moon in May 1976 - 29th  - 1st Quarter June 5th New Moon in June 1976 - 27th  - 1st Quarter July 4th New Moon in July 1976  - 29th  - 1st Quarter Aug 2nd   Credibility Factor:  I was 27 years old at the time of the occurrence with 3 small children.

But may have seen another red flashing light, which was smaller real close to it as it had slowed or was turning.  Almost as if it came from the object or was a part of the object.  It was flying pretty low so I did get a pretty good look at it. When it appeared to slow down/turn I could tell it was kind of chevron shaped,like a boomerang looking object.  It was moderate in size, probably a couple car lengths. I stopped to try to see more, but by this point it was gone.((NUFORC Note:  One of many reports from same source of alleged sightings of UFO&apos;s.  PD))",

While in the middle seat of the sixteen seater of the van, I was looking out at the window, something I just about always do when riding in a vehicle.  The UFO I saw was, from a side view, cigar shaped, but from my vantage point, I saw it was a disk shape.  It was... moving. I do not know of any U.S. craft that can move like this craft did.  Nor do I know of any disk shaped craft made by the U.S. or any other country.  It was spinning, then it was doing dips, flips, and turns at incredible speeds.  Then, it just seemed to vanish.Like I said, I do not know of any craft from any country that is not just shaped like it or can do what it did.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

20100210,20100210," Dothan, AL", flash,20 minutes,blinking lightsMe and my boyfriend were both outside enjoying the weather one night and when we decided to take out or trash we noticed this blinking light extremely brighter than all other stars in the sky.  It flashed from red to blue to green.  We stared at it for a minute or so and it moved maybe an inch in my perspective every two or three minutes.  We decided to see if we could see anymore so we turned around looking in the sky.  We found a total of four in a diamond pattern but very far apart.  We looked online to see if we could find any answers since we were obviously a little spooked but found nothing. It could have possibly been a star but we didnt figure that there would be four of them in such a pattern that was an exact diamond.,

The sky was clear, with few clouds around. I scanned the sky for just a second or two, and by the time I returned my focus to where the object had just been, it was gone. This incident has stuck with me ever since, and even though I saw the object for just a second or two, I can still picture it perfectly in my mind.The object as stated before was in the shape of a triangle.

It was about 6:30 in the morning, and we had just taken off.  The sky was dark and clear with very few clouds, and it was my second time on an airliner so I was looking out through the window. As we were passing over a town outside of milwaukee, I noticed a large spotlight passing over a few neighborhoods.  The yards and streets that it passed over were brightly illuminated.  You could see the grass in the fields and chimneys on the rooftops and such as they were being lit up as the light was passing, and you could see the outline of the light. I looked to see a helicopter or even a plane generating the light but I could not find one.  I told my grandpa to look over and check it out and he said he didn&apos;t know what it was either.  I was tempted to ask a flight attendant but noticed they were pretty busy, so I just let it go. The moon was out and full, but i&apos;ve never heard of the moon creating such a focused, concentrated light of which I saw. I followed the light up and you could see the light was in a conic, searchlight projection, but nowhere was there anything to be making it.  No tower, plane, or helicopter.  The light seemed to be shining down from about 1-2 hundred feet up.  I followed the light for a good 2-3 minutes and then it dissapeared.  It was sort of making the same path as the plane, except that it had more of a wavy pattern slowly angling away from the plane and it moved very quickly. It came back into sight again shortly after and then it just vanished, like if someone just flipped off the switch.  I don&apos;t know if anybody else had seen it, but it was clearly something strange.

I was sitting on a bench visiting with my mother when I noticed what I thought were 5 geese flying in a v formation from east to west.  After looking at them for a couple of seconds I was shocked realizing that they were not geese since the sun was reflecting upon them showing that they were actually metallic sphere like objects.  The sky was clear and the temp.was about 65 degrees.  With excitement I yelled UFO&apos;s and the 3 boys (22, 17, &amp;16 years old) came running to see.  I pointed them out and then I ran into the house to get the binoculars.  When I got back outside I tried to focus on the objects but I was to shaky so I handed them to my son&rsquo;s friend.  We were all screaming and laughing that we couldn&apos;t believe what we were seeing.  As they started to go behind the tree line we ran to the corale area in front of the house to continue watching them.  One of the spheres shot off back towards the east disapearing as the other four continued steady and equal distance apart on to the north/west- towards Austin&rsquo;s Bergstrom Airport.  They slowly just disappeared.  Right before they vanished a white prop plane (about the size of a cigarette butt) was traveling near and behind them to their south.  The plane must have seen them.  We heard the plane but no noise from the objects. The plane seemed to have been traveling faster than the spheres.  The spheres were low and slow flying well beneath the cloud cover.

We both stared at the sky, awaiting some other sight, looking for the object that made this strobe-like light, however the sky was clear, full of stars, and no object was seen, only the impression of the light in our eyes, as it does when a flash is seen... it re-appears and and fades for a few minutes afterwards which is normal. We were hoping to see an object that could have made this &quot;blinding&quot; flash, but nothing could be seen.  No silhouettes, no shapes, no sounds, nothing.

20100213,20100213," Sharon, VT", light,30 to 45 seconds,"Airplane-like light which seemed to spawn larger, brighter, stationary lights as it moved.Around 7:30 PM last night (Friday, 12 February 2010), my father was walking down our driveway to get the paper. It was extremely dark out, and the sky was very clear. As he was partway down the driveway, he noticed a group of lights to the north at an elevation of perhaps 45 to 60 degrees (Vermont&rsquo;s mountainous horizon makes this difficult to judge). They were blinking like the running lights on aircraft, but as if there were three or four aircraft passing right next to each other while heading in different directions. This apparent cluster was what caught his attention, but a moment later he observed the appearance of another light.This light, slightly to the south of the cluster, appeared much larger than the others did, my father estimating its apparent diameter to be at least four times that of the largest stars and planets from his perspective, with intensity to match. He described it as being a light orange-yellow color that made him think of a motorcycle headlamp. He wondered if it was from an aircraft&rsquo;s landing lights, but after a few seconds, it went out in the way that an incandescent lightbulb does when switched off. At this point, he saw that the group of smaller lights was no longer present, but one remaining light had moved south and was heading away from the point where the large light had been.The light moved south, still blinking every second or so. After a few seconds of it moving on this path, another large light appeared at the position of the smaller one. The smaller light kept moving, but the larger light remained completely stationary, not drifting or arcing in the way a flare or even a helicopter with a spotlight might. This happened twice more over the next few seconds, so that there were three large lights marking the smaller one&rsquo;s previous path.The small light made a &ldquo;u-turn&rdquo; back towards the north, blinking all the while. My father described as being as if a car going at a reasonable speed had made a 180-degree turn, but an aircraft going an equivalent speed for his viewpoint would have needed a much larger turning radius. After the smaller light had traveled some distance from the others, all three large lights went out simultaneously, in the same lightbulb-like way the first one had. Through all of this, my father had not heard the slightest sound, except for a large jet that approached from the south after the light finished its turn. The entire incident took less than a minute. At this point, he ran inside to get my mother and myself, but by the time we got outside the light had disappeared, and the jet passed over our house to the north.My father has excellent vision and hearing, a good knowledge of the conditions that can cause many aerial phenomena, and a great love of stargazing, but he has been at a loss to explain what he saw. If the bright lights had not appeared, he would have not given what he observed a second thought, but their intensity and utter lack of movement were like nothing he has ever seen. He has drawn a diagram of the lights&rsquo; path and thoroughly explained it to me, but I, too, cannot explain it. The only thought that occurred to me was that he might have seen some sort of ball lightning, but he witnessed an instance of ball lightning in his youth and said that it was not at all like what he saw. He also inquired at the nearest airport, but their only explanation was that Black Hawk helicopters have recently been in use nearby. We found this suggestion unlikely, as the helicopters that frequently pass near our house are particularly loud and my father heard no sounds save the engines of! the jet that appeared just before he ran to find us.In short, we are absolutely stumped as to what he might have observed.",

It  had yellowish windows that seemed to change  color to an orange-red.   It had tons of little windows the whole thing looked like a cartoon.  It came right at us and became 20 feet away.   We were so scared and ran off- we started to scream and cry.  We had left our phone so we went back for it, but we found it in our pocket.  By that time it had left, but we ran home.  When we got home we told my sister and my other cousins.  They didn&rsquo;t believe us at first, but we looked so scared that they did.  It seemed like we were almost abducted.

At the back of the field there are woods to the left that go behind apartments but also go down a steep hill that connects to someone&rsquo;s field for their horses.As we were walking closer and closer to the woods I suddenly saw the entire woods light up as if there was a giant flashlight beam over everything.  I stopped walking and asked my boyfriend, who is that?  I thought it had to be a person and when he looked at the woods he saw the light right before it disappeared.We were frozen to the spot, it was the scariest thing id ever seen and then my boyfriend noticed a light on our feet, it looked like a bluish light from one of those high powered flashlights and we thought it was the cops, we were in the park after hours, but when I looked all around me and no one was there, no cop was shouting at us and the light was a perfect circle around us like someone was above us so we looked up and of course saw nothing but that was even worse than seeing something so we ran full speed down the field.We didn&rsquo;t stop till we were all the way at the other end but my boyfriend looked back while we were running and he said he saw an orb of orange light gliding down the field, when I looked it was gone but we started running again anyways because we were afraid of being chased.We didn&rsquo;t go back to the park for awhile but a couple weeks later when I wasn&rsquo;t afraid anymore we went back.  That night my boyfriend and I had an argument so we sat under the pavilion to talk about it.   I had my back to the field but he was facing it and he pointed towards the woods and told me to look because he saw a bright orange light in the sky.  I looked but the light was gone.  I stared at the spot for a minute and then looked away when he said it came back and this time it was there.  The light was small,  from our view point it looked like the size of a beach ball.After about fifteen or twenty seconds the light started to expand.  It just got bigger and brighter, and then the most amazing unexplainable thing happened.  It seemed to unfold and it went from a big ball of light into exactly what you would picture a UFO to look like, a saucer shaped hover craft, except the light was so bright that it didn&rsquo;t have a defined shape.  It was like the sun on earth, it blurred the vision around the UFO and after five or ten seconds it started to descend behind the woods and I assume it landed in the field behind it.  My boyfriend and I wanted to get closer, to go find it but I refused to go in the woods at night.  Since then I haven&rsquo;t ever seen anything like that but I honestly now believe aliens or someone not like us is out there, watching, or maybe waiting for something.What I saw has inspired me to look up a lot of information on aliens and I think when these UFO&rsquo;s are seen it is by choice to determine when or if ever it will be acceptable for aliens to walk among us.",

As I looked up, basically straight up but facing west, I noticed a line of dim objects, about 30-40 (I will use rough numbers in my description because of how quick event happened) and my first thought was that it was birds reflecting the city lights, but then the objects split into 3 separate groups, one with about 10 objects, the middle one around 20 and the third (farthest group from me) was maybe about 15, again just rough numbers, I didn&rsquo;t have time to count!  The group was traveling in a southern direction, from where I was in Sunnyvale, I&rsquo;d say they were directly over Mountain View, about 2 miles west of me.  That path would take them over Cupertino, Saratoga, then the northern edge Santa Cruz Mountain range (around here we call them the Cupertino and Saratoga hills).  The group was moving at a good rate of speed, it was hard for me to focus on them because they were so spread out, and I was trying to see if I could discern any shape, which vaguely they were each a slight V-shape, but I&rsquo;m not 100% on that.  The whole sighting lasted maybe 10-15 seconds, and at the end of it they all seemed to group together and fade out, which is why I think they were only reflecting city light and they dimmed out going over the mountains.   A group of birds could not travel that distance that fast across this valley.  I tried to stay focus on the direction they faded out but saw nothing more.  About 30 seconds later I heard a plane and saw its ! flashing navigation lights, in the same west direction I was facing but far lower, I believe small planes over this area have to be around 1500-2000 ft, so using that these objects were higher, but I could not estimate for sure what height. They made no sound, and moved very quickly in combining and separating their groups.",
20100214,20100214," Las Vegas, NV", cylinder,A few seconds,"Short encounter with space craft on my way into my parking lot area.About five years ago, I was on my way into my apartment complex, and in the parking area, a space ship pulled up, and hovered a few feet off the ground, at about thirty feet from me.  It had a large fuselage, and at the top, there were a wing on each side that came out from the craft at the top of the fuselage about twenty five or so feet, and then took a sharp 90 degree downward bend extending about 15 feet.  The fuselage was not round but it was more like a boat hull but not noticeably rounded at the bottom, either.From the bottom of the craft to the top of the fuselage, it must have been between about thirty and forty or so feet and it must have been sixty to seventy feet to possibly eighty feet in length. There was arching violet to purple colored electricity all over the hull and wings of the craft but particularly the wings. The electricity reminded me of the kind you see in a TESLA coil. I could feel, smell, and hear the noises of the exhaust gasses as the ship hovered. There was a hatchway, a debarking/embarking stairway passage door, and there was a man about six feet tall standing in the hatchway. The hatchway was at the bottom of the fuselage, and behind him, you could see a staircase going up to a higher deck inside the ship. He just sort of looked at me, and I looked back. I didn&apos;t act surprised, and in another instant, the ship zipped away.((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate.

But in retrospect, after flipping backwards through my journal, ANY EVENT BEFORE 9-11 is significant.  I have searched for others&apos; reports of UFO activity on 9-10 but have found none, and therefore find it useful to finally let this information out for the universe to chew on.Here is my journal entry:  &quot;Monday 10 - Nighttime...walking back from Starbucks, I see a trapazoid shaped object flying through the sky...underneath this object were [many] faint lights...about 600-900ft off ground.&quot;  Context: I was an engineering student at the University of Texas at the time and was walking back to my dorm at the time.  I was standing right outside the University Coop on Guadalupe St., looking up above the UT Tower.  I was waiting at the crosswalk and had nothing better to do other than look up, when suddenly, I noticed these lights traveling at great speed.  At first I thought I was seeing birds illuminated by the UT Tower, but then birds don&apos;t travel that high, that smoothly, that quickly.The object was flying southbound passing nearly above the UT Tower, traveling towards the Texas Congressional building.  Now I&apos;m no expert, but I would assume that any area above UT/Texas Congress would be restricted, a no-fly zone.  My memory may be hazy here but I would say it traveled about a mile in 5 seconds.  That&apos;s roughly 720 mi/hr.

From my position I estimated it was pretty high, as the Long Beach air traffic was flying well below it.  Yet for ten minutes it did not move, so I ruled out balloon and blimp.

Etna), TN",,5 seconds,"Posess surprise daytime image of huge triangleFebruary 16, 2010,  I along with my father viewed an enormous triangle on a July/August evening of 1968 or perhaps 1969 in central Michigan.  The sighting was 5-7 minutes long.  We stopped my father&rsquo;s pick up truck, got out and viewed this massive triangle with a light in each corner.  The front light was huge and lit up the night, though it was as if a spotlight illuminated the ground below.  The other two lights were not as bright.  It was quiet, slow and defied what we knew of how planes fly.  My father is now 85.  A WWII vet and I am 55.We told only family at the time as it was and remains quite puzzling.  Fast forward.  I am a contractor of sorts indirectly for the DOD.  I was going up to the ski lodge on Mt. Etna to take a few photographs.  It was a beautiful day with perfectly clear skies.  I took some photographs from my car going up, a few times I pulled over to take the pictures.  I did not notice the image I captured having the triangle in it when I took it.  I simply took a picture from about 6000 feet of the summit.  When I viewed the taken image on the viewfinder, I saw it immediately, but thought of it as an orb.  When downloaded, it reveals what you see.  I know it appears to be invisible, but a daytime photo of this craft does not exist that I am aware of.  Also,  the front light is large and square edged, and there seems to be a circle of impulses near that large light.  It is a remarkable camera and I am a professional.  What do you think?",

As I was used to doing, I pulled my chair up to the campfire, sipped a coffee, listened to the CBC on the radio, and enjoyed the glory of the heavens.  Before climbing into my tent, I hit the &quot;head&quot;, which was a patch of bushes at the back of the site.I paused to take one last look into the clear, starry night. As I slowly scanned to the left of my field of view, I noticed what appeared at first to be a star, but soon realized that it was moving. It was a small, bright white light. It was no larger than an average star. There was no sound, and no other lights. Moved in a steady, unwavering path. It appeared to be quite a distance, perhaps orbital distance, but that&apos;s just a guess. I would say that its speed was twice that of a commercial airliner at that altitude. I thought, &quot;Hey, I think that must be a satellite&quot;, but it was now 2:00 AM, and satellites are not visible at that hour in my region.I followed it, with my eyes trained on it, as it moved from far left, until it reached the center of the sky, directly overhead. Suddenly, it was gone! I kept looking, further to the right, trying to pick it up again. No, it was gone.After desperately trying to relocate it, I looked back to my left again. Again, I spotted a bright white light, larger than the first, and traveling the exact same path. It was the same as above, but larger, about thrice the size. I followed it as well. When this second one reached the same, exact spot as the first one, it too disappeared from view! I was shocked! It was right there, and in an instant, gone.Again, it was a crystal clear night. There were no clouds. There was no sound.Early that night, and on other nights, I had watched jets cross the night sky, only to disappear beyond the horizon. These two craft, simply disappeared. Needless to say, I didn&apos;t sleep too well that night. I am still wondering just what it was that I saw that night.Note: I only just learned of this Web-site, which is the reason for the delay in reporting.",

I thought it is a heading light of an aircraft landing as my area is in the airport landing way.  The direction of the light was from the west to the east and this is not the airport runway direction so i started to dout about the light and also it was a single light and aircrafts are having blinking lights plus the heading.the light was moving very very slow for long time then it started to become very weak slowly till it is totally switched off.  after the light switched off i could trace the moving object as it was a clerly circle shape shaded object in front of the sky stars plus a very weak green colored as if a lamp switched off.

The object was about &frac14; to &frac12; mile from the freeway and about 1,000 feet up.  I would say 3 times the height of a tower.  It was clearly a craft; there was no discernable fuselage, wings or rotor. It appeared in the shape of a football, and I could see into it enough to see more lights.

It didn&apos;t have any of the typical characteristic movement patterns of a plane either.  I got my sister from inside to come observe with me.  She also agreed that it didn&apos;t appear to be anything like a plane or anything that she recognized.  The object still had a bright iridescent white shine as it slowly moved.  As I watched it more, the object seemed to dim in radiance of the white glow being shown, as if the light was being dimmed down.  The object seemed to stay in one place and then slowly move in a linear fashion.  Not anything like any aircraft.  The object then appeared to start flashing different colors. It would flash a bright red, then bright green, bright blue, and yellow and then back to white in no particular order.  It seemed like the entire object donned the color that it turned to, much unlike blinking aircraft lights that are separated by wing space.  As the object turned different colors it seemed to hover in one place.  It would then slowly do a somewhat figure eight pattern or a circular movement pattern and would at instances seemingly accelerate very quickly and then slow back down and then just hover in place.  It kept doing this and I went inside after about 20 minutes.  I came back out hours later and it was gone.",

I now believe it was not a dream but an abduction experience.  This occurred in Huntsville, Alabama at night. I have three memories: I was placed in a seat that looked like plastic similar to fast food restaurants.  It was curved and had a high back that protruded above my head.  I was not belted in the seat but I was stuck there and could not move.  My eyes were open but unable to move so I could only see in front of me.  There was a man sitting across from me in a same type of seat, and he was not moving either.  I could see more seating behind him but with the design I could not see anyone sitting.The second memory I woke up and was on a table in the middle of a room.   I was laying with my head in the south and my feet in the north.  My eyes could not look around, but I could see part of the ceiling and part of the wall on my right.  It appeared to look rounded and somewhat reminded me of commercial office partitions, grey/silver and flat.  I did not know where I was, then my head rolled to the left and I saw a woman walking up a small ramp to a door that I heard open with a &quot;swish&quot; sound, like a hatchback car when you open it.  I could see a little of the hall way and it appeared to curve slightly.The woman was wearing a red bodysuit and seemed to be physically fit.  I saw her head was different, it was larger in the back like it was deformed and her hair was blonde and extremely thin like a chemo patient that is losing most of their hair.  She was on the west side of the room and to the left of me.She had to know I was looking at her from behind because after the door opened she quickly turned and looked at me.  I saw her in the front view before she knocked me back out apparently with her mind, she did not say anything.  Her body seemed human but I have never seen a face similar to her.She had a bigger forehead and bigger eyes than a human, her nose was extremely small, almost no cartilage and reminds me of Michael Jacksons small nose.  Her mouth was small too with very thin lips.The last memory I was in a different seat facing west looking at black windows.  I saw the seat I had been in and it was emply, I still could not look around but I saw a door to the north behind the seat I was in in the first memory.

20100219,20100219," Winnie, TX", changing,17 minutes,"Very eerily silent, complete vulnarability, Sense of being watched and thoughts readLong Description of Sighting Report  My friend and I were in route from Port Arthur to Houston, traveling west bound on Highway 73, we had just passed the landfill(between Winnie Tx.)  The time was about 11:45Pm.  We were visiting my aunt, in ICU in Port Arthur.I had just activated(the Google Navigator)on my 3G phone.  I was thinking to myself how cool!, we are tracking in virtual time on a satalite map...&quot;this must be the way we appear from an arial view.&quot;  At that same instant my friend who was driving,in a calm collective manner says, &quot;See I told you that there are UFO&apos;s around here!&quot;  I looked up, my eyes immeadiately fixated, to the top left corner of the windshield.And....Sure enough!!!  There IT was!!!!  Traveling east bound, about 200 ft above the hwy.  It appeared to be pulsating a irradescent/flouresent bright rainbow color, however all of the colors displayed at the same time........I find that words are very difficult to express completely what we expireinced!!!  There is just not any vocabulary that I know of that can replicate what we saw!!  However, I will continue at the risk of sounding completely out of my mind...lol There were three Rumboid shaped pulsating objects they seemed to be seperate, but yet as one unit?!?!?  silently/fluidly traveling east bound,paralell to hwy 73...  I have always had a scientific curriosity.... I asked my friend&quot;DID YOU SEE THAT?!?!WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!!!????  four times, I also rolled all of the car windows down and I opened the sun roof.  This was to reassure myself that we were&apos;nt just seeing a reflection off of the car&apos;s glass and the fact that my friend confirmed four times that we were both seeing the same phenomina. As I opened the sun roof, never taking my eyes off of the object, I popped my head up through the sun roof, and said WOW!!!! that&apos;s no reflection!!!  That&apos;s a Bonified UFO!  That very instant, the object made an immeadiate U-turn!!!!!!!!!  And now it was following us down hwy73!!!  I never once left visual contact with the object.  I jumped down into my seat and shouted &quot;THEY ARE COMING!!!! THEY ARE FOLLOWING US!!  keep in mind that this is a dark and d! esolate hwy at this time of the night.I kept my eye on it, while my friend was franticly speeding up to get away!  I could see the same colors pulsating 100FT above the pavement behind us!! ,but it seemed very different than what colors you or I are use to???!!! I was almost hypnotysed by this strange sight&hellip;  That&apos;s when I realized that we were not only being folowed but, also being monitored on a level that no Human/Animal could even begin to comprehend!!!  I could see the triangle shaped pulsating Rumboids getting larger, and closer, leaving and getting smaller, and yet not moving at all?!!?!?!?  well my friend, as strange as it may sound, all of this was taking place simutaneousley,  My eyes and brain were not quiet sure how to process all of this together!  We became panicked and sped up to approx. 120mph.  Again this thing never changed perspective, of course we were speeding, but the object stayed behind us, but not ever moving?!!??!!? My friend says to me&quot;STOP STARING AT IT&quot;!! The object got almost to the back of my car, then I noticed a yellow/amberish colored column of light slowly coming down to the ground from the object... then the column of light became very very bright, nontransparent, and became almost like an orange fire ball. I could see the grass and the dirt flying about ,under this fireball!! I started screaming&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;THEY ARE GOING TO BLOW US UP!!!!!!!&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; that instanst, the object started to wobble? And the air all around it seemed to ripple as if it were H20?!?!?! Then the object became one with the column of orange/yellow light, it reminded me of how Mercury looks on a hard surface. And all in the same split second, the object then became a bright large sphere, with the same pulsating colorfull pattern... I was shell shocked!!!! Did i just see that take place in this demension/this planet/this Whatever!!!!! By this time I could feel a presence in my persona,,,,not anything unusual,,,no strange voices, but almost like my subconcious ! was suddenly in charge?!!?!I never once felt threatened in that sense, but I was subtlely able to become aware of this new/unfamilair feeling in my head?!?! Sounds lunicital ,I know!!!! but like I said, there is no vocabulary that we have as a species that could come close to propperly describing these events,senses,feelings,&quot;phenominas&quot; We continued for for few minutes, then I noticed two cars traveling east bound were coming,after what seemed like an eternity!! I was wide eyed of course waiting to see if those cars would notice what was following us. Sure enough.......they all slammed on thier brakes and pulled to the side of the road!!! at that time the object behind us, backed down and in a split second, the sphere divided into two and disapered!!!!!! I feel like someone else out there had to have seen something. if so please share.  I feel a sense of isolation from people who have never expireinced these phenominas,  Almost like I can not communicate to them the events that took place that cold clear stary night! I cant help but look to the sky every moment I am outdoors!!!!  I am still a bit &quot;rattled&quot; not threatened per say...but I have a sense that who/what ever that was, is still out there, and knows where I am and what I think before I think it!!!!! well there you go!!! that&apos;s my first encounter/interaction with anything/one that has that magnitude of capabilities..",

It appeared to be coming towards us but then as it seemed to be getting closer it changed direction and veered towards the horizon, climbing into the sky until it faded out of sight.I asked my husband what he thought and he agreed with me, it looked like a fireball, the flames very clearly visible. There were no other lights surrounding it, no noise and as many airports operate in this area, planes are easily distinguishable from this.  This was a definite ball of light and as said, flames inside visible to the naked eye.We are not sure whether it was some jet engined aircraft or an actual fireball.  But the beach this night was very busy with people and this was simply too big to miss, so we are just waiting to see if others report it.",
20100220,20100220," Cancun (Mexico),", chevron,10 minutes,"Glowing objects flying over CancunWhile on a business trip to Cancun, an associate and I were the only tourists lounging by the unlit hotel pool and gazing at the stars.  We simultaneously observed what we thought was a shooting star streak across the sky.  As we &quot;ahhed&quot; in pleasure at the sight, the &quot;shooting  star&quot; stopped above our heads and reversed direction.  We immediately became silent and confused when another &quot;shooting star&quot; streaked back toward us crossing the path of the first object at a sharp angle. At this point, we both confirmed that we were actually seeing the same thing.  The objects both turned and then slowly headed back toward each other and appeared to come together and turned away at extremely tight angles.  As we watched, another object streaked across the paths of the first two.  During the time we watched, these lightly glowing objects continued to streak across the travel paths of each other.  They moved slowly when they were grouped near each other and we could see that they were more or less chevron shaped with the entire shape being defined by a clear, visible glow.  The glow was about the same intensity of the surrounding stars with a greenish tint to the light they appeared to emit.   All of their movement was in straight lines or at sharp angles, creating invisible triangular travel paths as they flew past and crossed over each other.  Occasionally, they would come together for a fraction of a second only to break away quickly in different angular patterns.One of the hotel employees was cleaning the pool.  He did not speak English and my Spanish was quite rusty.  However, when I asked about what we were observing, I understood him to explain that these were birds and they glowed because of the plankton in the waters that that also glowed.The explanation seemed acceptable to a point.  That could certainly explain the greenish glow and the chevron shape.  However, I live in an area where there are a lot of hawks and falcons that fly on the thermals created in the hills of my community.  I have not seen any of these birds flying in the angular patterns that I observed.  Their turns tend to be more gentle and curved.  I have seen none of these birds come together but would allow that at night, seeing the objects seemingly meet may have been an illusion as one object could have been above or below the other.  This does not explain how the objects would consistently appear to break away from each other and travel in different directions but I feel that even some of those observations could also be attributed to illusion and vision impairment created by the night skies.  Perhaps the most extraordinary behavior that gives me pause to question the bird explanation more than any other is the fact that all of their movement appeared to be in straight lines with all turns seemingly to be accomplished only with sharp angular movement.  I have since attempted to research sea bird sightings under similar circumstances and watch the movement of other groups of birds but have found no descriptions that seem to fit my experience.   At this time, I cannot say for sure that what I saw but they were not shooting stars.  However, I have seen that other visitors to Cancun have described similar sightings at later dates.",

Evening dark sky partly cloudy. One witness was at his work walking his normal route. As he walked outside of the building he was in. He looked around at his surroundings and a very bright red light in the sky caught his attention. He looked to the south eastern sky and saw a group of red lights. They were blinking or turning on and off. It seemed to be in a pattern then turned randomly and one small white light in the middle of them all on for the duration of the sighting. It was slow moving to the north west from the south west. The witness looked at the lights and could not make of it any conventionally known craft other than experimental. The planes that usually fly by have red, white and green lights that are flashing or blinking in a sequence. These did not match of those seen normally. And military aircraft run infrared or red and green lights. At about 21:09, the witness took some video and pictures with his cell phone but are useless due to th! e poor technology in cell phone cameras. The red lights were traveling north west to the San Gabriel Mountains near Azusa, CA when it makes an abrupt turn north. And goes north over the mountains and seems to be exactly leveled with the peaks of the mountains which are around 6,000 ft. And was not seen again at about 21:11 hours.No body or fuselage could be clearly seen with the red lights. The red lights all seemed to be attached to something other than being in formation separately. One white light in the middle of the other lights that seem to be on at all times but very dim. The red lights seen were 2-3 red lights at front of the group of lights, 2-3 on the sides of it and 2-3 at the rear. The witness thinks the object was a triangle shape due to the position of the lights. The altitude would be an approximate of 7-15,000 ft. No sound was herd from the lights. Nothing else unusual was seen that night.The witness is has seen many commercial aircraft in the area before and is knows what to look for in normal characteristics. This sighting could be an experimental conventional military aircraft of sorts but it was unidentified flying object that could possibly be the real thing.",

It was completely dark..no aircraft lights at all and completely silent.  If, I held out my arm, it would take my entire hand to fully block the object. It blended in perfectly to the night sky.  It was more like watching an invisible shape blocking the sky behind it as it moved.

I was curious as to what it was since it was not moving, but standing completely still in mid-air, too high in the sky to be a cell phone tower.  As we proceeded to get closer, the light, we noticed, was actually 2 spot lights.  At that point we thought it was a plane, the lights being the 2 wing lights.  I began to notice a &quot;shooting&quot; type light, flickering from side to side, from one white light to the other.  I know that a plane&apos;s wing lights flicker, but they don&apos;t shoot across the plane&apos;s wings!  At this point, I was sure it was an alien craft.  I kept my eye on this thing the whole trip, and as we came to the stop light, we were directly beneath it, as it hadn&apos;t moved the entire time we were driving.  I actually rolled the window down and looked up into the sky to witness yet another light, which formed a perfect triangle with the other 2 light! s, and was sitting still in the sky as of yet.  I said to my friend, &quot;This is a UFO, an alien craft!&quot;  As I said this, the craft then (after 15 minutes of keeping my eye on it) began to move slowly with the wide end of the triangle as the front of the craft, shooting lights and all, and headed south toward the Monee/Peotone area.  I took my eyes off of the craft and then immediately noticed 6 or 7 more identical lights in the sky around the Frankfort/Mokena/Tinly Park area.  They were the same color, brightness, and height as the previously seen craft.  They looked just like the first one before I was close enough to see the shooting light.",

The best description of how bright the light was relates to the science experiments done in school when burning magnesium.  This light was not a flare, was consistently bright, did not have a chemical trail and left no sound/wake.As soon as we noticed the single, very large, bright light, it took approximately 1.5 seconds and it moved due south at a high velocity.  Within that 1.5 seconds it had moved from our position we noted to a point in the horizon we could no longer see &ndash; it had in essence disappeared.  The best description of the velocity is similar to watching either star wars or star trek when the ship moves to hyperdrive/warp speed.Yet, there was no sonic boom typical of high velocity aircraft.

20100221,20100221," Coos Bay, OR", circle,30-45 seconds,"Glowing green light near street intersection spotted, then shoots straight up.I&rsquo;ve had weird, unexplained things happen to me over the years but on 11-02-2010 it was visually strange.  It was a clear night and I had just left Fred Meyers store at about 8:30 pm  As I was driving up Central Ave. toward Ocean Blvd.  I thought I saw at the top of Central and Ocean a green light over the flashing yellow light.  My first thought was oh no they didn&rsquo;t put a stop light up here!  But as I got closer I realized that the light (the same color as a green traffic light) was bigger and higher up then the flashing yellow light.  It looked like it it was behind the Methodist church where there are big power lines.  It wasn&rsquo;t like a regular green light because the light glowed and moved around, like millions of fireflies.  Now my curiosity as to what I was looking at kept me driving toward it.  Just as I realized what  I thought it was there was a flash and it shot straight up in the sky leaving a yellow trail of something that had been shot! out of it.  I was so shocked at what I saw!  You hear about them but you never plan on seeing one.  Total time from seeing it to it vanishing was about 30 to 45 sec. I went home as scheduled and told my children who believed my story.  I didn&rsquo;t give it much thought after that.A week later on 11-07-2010 I had just gotten out of my car from work and  again it was around 8:30 pm when for some reason I looked up over my apartment.  It was again a clear night and I saw a white star move.  I continued to look at this &lsquo;star&rsquo; which as high as it was I figured it was over Empire Lakes which is behind my apartment building complex.  As I continued to watch the star it started to glow bright and get larger.  Then it shot off north leaving again a yellowish trail behind it shooting south.  I was shocked but not surprised.  This also took about 30 to 45 secs.  Again I went in and told the kids that I just saw another one.  Again they believed me.The only thing that really makes all of this weird is that two days later I woke up at 10:00 am.  Everyone in the apartment, including the cats were still asleep.  I found this odd as my 9 year old granddaughter who slept with me at the time is usually up at the crack of dawn.  My cat Yuki cries at the door at 9:00 am every morning like clockwork to be fed.  I was the only person awake.  Gradually, everyone was up and about and seemed sluggish.  I discovered that I didn&rsquo;t feel well, had a headache and my throat and windpipe were extremely dry, like bone dry.  My lymph nodes in my throat were swelled up to bursting and I had three horizontal cuts on the bottom right side of my mouth.  I felt like this for about five days.  I didn&rsquo;t get checked out by a doctor as I didn&rsquo;t have any health insurance at the time.  I do have an appointment in March and I will ask the doctor to check out the marks in my mouth. Previously in 2003 to 2004 I had lived off Seven Devils Road in a secluded spot on the ocean on Tokyo Lane.  I didn&rsquo;t write down exact times of the things that happen to me while the kids and I lived there.  I was constantly plagued by the Coast Guard helicopter flying directly and very close to my house at 2 or 3:00 in the morning several times a month.  When I say close I mean just over my roof top!  I thought that they may  be rescuing someone but there were never any reports of vessels needing assistance and they weren&lsquo;t near the water.  One time I woke up to what I thought was a spot light over the house and thinking the Coast Guard was at it again.  I got up out of bed to flip them off.  Just as my feet hit the floor I heard the Coast Guard coming?  The light went out and I got back into bed to hear the Coast Guard once again fly as fast as they can from the station, south toward Bandon.I woke up one time with every joint  in my body on fire.  When I say joint I  mean every place that a bone connects to another bone.  This lasted  for about 20 min. and then the pain faded away.  It was an uncomfortable feeling living there and night time was always stressful.  I was fatigued all the time, the children said they felt like they were being watched.  We left in 02-2004 and the children and I were grateful to leave and move back into town.Apparently, it doesn&rsquo;t matter where you live.  I have shared this with very few people.  My friend in California believes my stories and is greatly concerned.  Hopefully, this will help and in some way be another piece of the puzzle.",

It swooped from the north and turned and swooped to the east and up and out towards the north . Then I saw the last small round white object follow in the same direction.

We looked to the North and an object was raising up from the lava beds.  It was round and shiny on top.  It was not more than around one quarter mile away and maybe 300 to 400 feet high.  We had just eaten our lunch, so it was mid day.  A very clear and sunny day.  It was a FLYING SAUCER, plain and clear.  We had apparently disturbed a landed craft.  We watched it with our survey equipment as it just hovered there .  It rocked back and forth while there, apparently observing us.  It was very saucer shaped and never made a sound.

We were visiting my aunt, in ICU in Port Arthur.I had just activated(the Google Navigator)on my 3G phone. I was thinking to myself how cool!, we are tracking in virtual time on a satalite map...&quot;this must be the way we appear from an arial view.&quot; At that same instant my friend who was driving,in a calm collective manner says&quot; See I told you that there are UFO&apos;s around here!&quot; I looked up, my eyes immeadiately fixated, to the top left corner of the windshield.And....Sure enough!!! There IT was!!!! traveling east bound, about 200 ft above the hwy. It appeared to be pulsating a irradescent/flouresent bright rainbow color, however all of the colors displayed at the same time........I find that words are very difficult to express completely what we expireinced!!! There were three Rumboid shaped pulsating objects they seemed to be seperate, but yet move as one unit?!, silently/fluidly traveling east bound,paralell to hwy 73. I have always had a scientific curriosity....I asked my friend&quot;DID YOU SEE THAT?!?!WHAT THE HELL IS THAT! I also rolled all of the car windows down and I opened the sun roof. This was to reassure myself that we were&apos;nt just seeing a reflection off of the car&apos;s glass.The fact that my friend confirmed seeing the same object, I knew that we were both looking at the same phenomina. As I opened the sun roof,never taking my eyes off of the object, I popped my head up through the sun roof,and said WOW!!!! that&apos;s no reflection!!! That&apos;s a Bonified UFO! That very instant, the object made an immeadiate U-turn!! And now it was following us down hwy73!!! I never once left visual contact with the object. I jumped down into my seat and shouted&quot;THEY ARE COMING!!!!THEY ARE FOLLOWING US!! keep in mind that this is a dark and desol! ate hwy at this time of the night.I kept my eye on it, while my friend was franticly speeding up to get away! I could see the same colors pulsating 100FT above the pavement behind us!!,but it seemed very different than what colors you or I are use to!!!I was almost hypnotysed by this strange sight...That&apos;s when I realized that we were not only being folowed but, also being monitored on a level that no Human/Animal could even begin to comprehend!!! I could see the triangle shaped pulsating Rumboids getting larger, and closer, leaving and getting smaller, and yet not moving at all?!! All of this was taking place simutaneousley, My eyes and brain were not quiet sure how to process all of this together! We became panicked and sped up. Again this thing never changed perspective, of course we were speeding, but the object stayed behind us, but not ever moving?!! My friend says to me&quot;STOP STARING AT IT&quot;!! The object got almost to the back of my car, then I noticed a yellow/amberish colored column of light slowly coming down to the ground from the object... then the column of light became very very bright, nontransparent, and became almost like an orange fire ball. I could see the grass and the dirt flying about ,under this fireball!! I started shouting&quot;THEY ARE GOING TO BLOW US UP!!&quot; that instanst, the object started to wobble. And the air all around it seemed to ripple as if it were H20?!? Then the object became one with the column of orange/yellow light, it wobbled and streched,it reminded me of how Mercury looks on a hard surface. And all in the same split second, the object then became a bright large sphere, with the same pulsating colorfull pattern... I was shell shocked!!!! Did I just see that take place in this demension/this planet/this Whatever!!!!! By this time I could feel a presence in my Phycie,not anything unusual,no strange voices, but almost like my subconciou! s was suddenly in charge!? I never once felt threatened in that sense, but I was subtlely able to become aware of this new/unfamilair feeling in my head?!?! Sounds lunicital ,I know!!, but like I said, there is no vocabulary that we have as a species that could come close to propperly describing these events,senses,feelings,&quot;phenominas&quot; We continued for for few minutes, then I noticed two cars traveling east bound were coming,after what seemed like an eternity!! I was wide eyed of course waiting to see if those cars would notice what was following us. Sure enough.......they all slammed on thier brakes and pulled to the side of the road!!! at that time the object behind us, backed down and in a split second, the sphere divided into two and disapered!!!!!! I feel like someone else out there had to have seen something. if so please share. I feel a sense of isolation from people who have never expireinced these phenominas, Almost like I can not communicate to them the events that took place that cold clear stary night! I cant help but look to the sky every moment I am outdoors!!!!

As I drew closer to it.It started to move off over the eastern Whitby very slow and over western Oshawa ,Ontario.  This one is a new one for me. Could it have been military?  It was that big whatever it was  and even kind of spooky-due to the distant spread of the three white lights. It was definitely not a helicopter, it was way too long, not to mention the lighting sequence. Theruby red light seem to be rotating in flashing.

It was during the school year almost at dusk. The remaining daylight showed what I remember as a huge craft that looked like what I seen off of Star Wars. It was going as slow as we were, almost as it was floating. it stayed with us until the turn off of Old Richmond Road. It was like it was using the road also. I remember yelling to my Father to follow it. He looked as he seen a ghost as my Mother told him no. Other cars and trucks were driving fast to follow. I remember that like it was yesterday. It was posted in the Little River News and also aired on the local 10 o&apos;clock News. Stories were told for a long time until suddenly falling silent. The morning of 2/24/10 I just left Texarkana, AR from shopping late night I felt like riding some old back roads and listen to my newly installed sound system that is very loud. I did not want to disturb the! working class town folk, because I know how it feels to wake up to loud music on a work day. I cut down the road that leads behind our paper mill, Domtar. It is just a little North of the town Ogden, AR. I hate to admit this, but I got a little lost down further I drove. It has been years since I have driven that route. I got turned around several times and seemed like i went around in circles. I knew what community I was in just not were exactly i was. A while after driving very slow on the gravel road I felt like I was being followed. That is because I have noticed a light that seems to stay the same distance behind me when I travel down Highway 32 going East towards Asdown. It always originate around my parents home community of Arden. It seems not only to follow me from there on that road but stays a good distance behind me on every road I take leaving from that area. I have driven out to the wooded area called Gum Flats, which is a very wooded area that covers a lot o! f land from Foreman, Ar to Wilton and Ashdown, AR to see if I ! could ca tch a show like i did when I was 9 years old. I did not think to try crossing Highway 32 and covering the South part of the area. It is very different almost like a marsh like swamp land with its fair share of large remote and hard to get places. This stretch of land is between Ashdown and Foreman is covered with crops and cattle farms. A very large if not more is very remote and has lots of wildlife including lots of water beds and creeks that leads for miles. When some of it felt familiar I got fed up and started to feel like I should stop these kids or so called buddies from playing these jokes on me. I have only been without a job for a month but i started to ride the old back roads again a lot to ease my mind and plan my future. I figured my friends was doing a little joke to keep me on my toes. I guess I was wrong, when I cut down a narrow road and turned around very quickly, it was almost a little bigger than one lane. Being far enough down the road that had a fence r! oad on both sides, I should have caught a glimpse of the back end of any vehicle if it had turned around like I did. I drove very fast to catch them but did not see or hear any sign of a vehicle or people present. I knew that there had to be something following me because when i went down a long straight road that had a street light at where i started the road that left a perfect light on the road i saw on down a shadow that broke the light and moved a little left and right. With no trees to do this and still being straight I new they were behind me fixing to fool around again. I never heard a sound when I stopped and killed the engine no gravel crunch, no sudden stop and slide that is when I realized I told no one that I was there. Feeling like a fool i started back on the road and saw a shadow in the distance like a house or barn with a yard and cars. As I got closer I saw a reflection of a dull metal gleam from my headlights. It was like a normal reflection off a metal b! uilding but shinier and the shine seamed to go away and come b! ack. I t hought I lost my mind and should call a local friend to help me get home so i could get to bed. When I got close to the house it had a dull brown or tan color that could not have any kind of reflection. In middle of that what i thought would be me mentally breaking down finally going mad like my girlfriend has been accusing me of being when I told my Lighted Jokes Following story, I realized I knew the bridge I was driving upon.I took the side road that is numbered County Road 9, which I have been on many times also have a few friends that live on and near the rough road. Feeling frisky and Awaken I turned my Stereo full blast on the best song I cold find on my Flash drive that had the loudest base also when this flash drive is in my player it has a bright flashing blue light that is random flashes. Grabbing the New L.E.D. flash light I bought earlier I turned it on and shined it out side in many directions randomly and switching directions very quickly. I also was driving n! ot straight but from one side to the next staying kind of centered on the road, like i was bouncing from one ditch to the other. Slowly getting closer to the houses that live closer to the highway 32 which this road leads I came around a curve that is not sharp 2 lights flashed on almost like the flash light i played with and the flash drive that was flashing. My first thought was I was seen acting a fool on the road by our local Wildlife Officers of the Law making sure our wildlife friends was not being harmed by poachers out of season (great job fellas!) After seeing two I noticed they were getting brighter, when all of a sudden 8 to nine more flashed on creating a shape that looked a lot like I have seen before but did not grasp at the moment. I still blamed my good buddy for taking a joke to far, so I went toward the lights thinking they where in a tree stationed waiting on me. It was not to far away when i saw no tree and this Huge U.F.O. floating above me it was like ! a stealth camo it was dressed in because all i could see was t! he brigh t lights and what looked like its paint or body of the vehicle was bending light so it looked like the sky around it. when I stopped the car and turned off the radio it also stop approaching me it was huge like a large non perfect oval hole in sky with lights. I wanted to get as close as I could to touch it, when I drove a few more feet the lights went out and I still saw it there like it was trying to hide with the camo paint job that reminds me of the movie Predator, where I still saw its shape but it tried to blend in the sky. I saw it glide slowly to the field to the right and what I thought land, without having a great light I could not say for sure. I stopped and started to get out so I can see what I can learn about this thing that haunts me. Without emotions or feelings I was full of a urge to finish this 24 years of wonder. Then thought to myself what if something happens to me no one would know because I did not inform any one about me being lost and driving all ov! er these back roads. I sadly left and went down to my friends with a thought of finding out what that is if I even have to walk for days in the marsh, camping and getting cold, wet, and finding out why it messes with me. Maybe I am at the right places at the wrong times and they feel threatened by me. First question my buddy got was if he was involved. He looked like he got pale and told me no, and if I remember one night about 4 or 5 months back when me and my brother visited we went to a old property and he saw lights above the trees move around and we did not listen or look cause we thought he was playing. &quot;well same lights&quot; he said and seen them off and on around the same place. The way he talked with his tone I did believe him. Next day i rode with him and my brother to my cousin&apos;s house to get a stove. I only would go if I could see this road in daylight. He drove faster than I liked, but I saw the grand scale of how much wet lands I would have to cover to end this my! stery. Moving the stove I fooling around told my cousin I know! you are involved. he said &quot;for what&quot;. I said Causing the lights to flash in front of my car. He got scared and was loudly say those things are for real many times and said it was about midnight the night I saw them when he was scared by them back in the house and went to bed thinking he was seeing things.      I do not believe in the other worldly aliens. I like Sci-Fi but outer space beings do not make me think they came to earth for deserts, swamps, and cattle to probe. I have seen many aircraft flights that were over my parents home were we lived since I was in 2nd grade. They have been large and small copters with many jet engine aircraft making the same path over the house. I was even Nearly Knocked off my feet by a Bomber I think was a F-1 it was big and very loud it flew right above the ground at tree top level. With many bases around and lots of remote land that maybe no one can reach. Our Military Force may have a very quiet stealth machine that has new camo like armor and! super flight abilities. I would like to know why we have not seen one in combat it seems like the tech has not changed since i seen 25 years ago or that of what I researched. the lights from the early 50s is the same shape and size. I know i am not the only one to see this ship. I am not scared to tell my story, because I want to put it out in the open and I will find this thing or many things if it is one of many that breaks off from a larger ship to do test runs in isolated areas using its stealth shell and flight controls to see if it can be spotted by civilians who drive or live in these areas. Also my vehicle did not get shut down by e.m.p. at the time we were face off, but the day after my electrical systems started to act up. first my radio was reset of all my settings like the battery was unhooked or reset. my electric windows and locks did not work also my transmition will not go in gear. When I checked engine over my battery was leaking acid like it exploded from! a short. I now am without a ride so I am even more ready to f! ind this thing and face it to find my answers as well as what other would like to know.  If any person like my self know any more info that will lead to the closure of this mystery please help and tell of your encounters.",

20100226,20100226," Orofino/Weippe, ID", triangle,20 minutes,"Triangle as big as a CITYI am submitting this report ten years since it happened.  I have had dreams &ldquo;vividly&rdquo; off and on since it happened.  Just recently,  I began experiencing these dreams again.  After searching on the Internet for the meaning of these dreams I found this site.  I am a very &ldquo;down to earth&rdquo; type person that usually believes in only Science and Facts.  I have heard many stories from family and others about UFO&rsquo;s.  And never believed until ten years ago.It was the summer of 2000.  I was traveling down Highway 11, a country road between Weippe Idaho and Orofino Idaho.  I was on my way to Orofino Idaho after visiting a friend in Weippe.  This stretch of road is in the middle of nowhere.  It is on top of a mountain surrounded by wheat fields.  The most you might see normally is a deer in your path.  About 2130 as I entered an area of the road known as &ldquo;Fraser&rdquo; (Fraser is a small section of land named after a few old time farmers from the past) I was shocked to see several lights hovering over a mountain top roughly (as the crow fly&rsquo;s) 25 miles away.  This particular part of the mountain has no what so ever houses or lights and barely any roads.  As I slowed to a near stop I noticed two other vehicles pulled over looking at the lights.  One was a beat-up pickup and one was a station wagon type car.  I pulled in behind them and turned off my lights.  I immediately got out my binoculars and started surveying the lights.  What I ! saw was literally &ldquo;out of this WORLD&rdquo;.  There was 6 lights surrounding one singular light in the middle.  The light in the middle was very strange as it was not as bright and pulsated from green to blue to red and back again.  The shape was in a perfect triangle shape just like a upright Pyramid.  The most Awesome thing about this was the size.  It had to be as big as a CITY!  Measuring the only way I knew how, I stretched out my thumb and forefinger and put it up to the sky, It was as I said a good 25 miles away and was at least 3 &frac12; inches between my thumb and finger in width.  That would make it at least a mile or more wide at this distance.  I and the others watched it for at least ten minutes.  The lights where so close to the top of the mountain it was over that it actually lit up the peak.  After about ten minutes the Station wagon car took off down the road back towards Weippe at a high rate off speed almost hitting me.  Just then the &ldquo;object&rdquo; turned slowly just so y! ou could see it&rsquo;s bottom 3 lights.  Those three lights slowly ! powered up &ldquo;got very bright&rdquo; and the whole thing disappeared in a explosion of light.  Just like you would see on Star Trek when they went into &ldquo;Warp&rdquo; drive.  I then, dumb founded went over to the pickup truck to see what they had seen only to realize that there was no one in the truck at all.  I think that they all left in the other car, or the pickup was empty to began with.  I think back and could slap my self for not getting the trucks licence plate number if only to verify that I was not going nuts!  I then drove home very shaken up and tried to go to sleep with no luck.The dream that I keep having involves this craft coming over the horizon and a feeling of &ldquo;impending doom&rdquo; like the world is going to end.  I know this sounds unbelievable but it is true.  I am of sound mind and have never told this to anyone other than my wife.",

As I got out of my car I was looking at the Eastern part of the sky, which is very open from my driveway and this night was particularly clear. I instantly spotted two faint glowing orange lights off in the distance out of the Northeastern part of the sky that were headed South. The two objects, which had what I would describe as a fiery glow, were moving in formation, with one apparently leading the other and at a slightly higher altitude in the sky from my vantage point. The objects were traveling at a steady pace and appeared to float across the sky. I could not make out any sound coming from the objects, and to my knowledge they did not make any noise. I ran in to my front yard to try and track the two objects as they glided across the sky and disappeared behind my neighbors house. I ran to my side yard and around the back of my neighbors house, but the objects had vanished. T! he event was very brief but profound, I would have given anything to have had someone there with me to witness what I saw. This event felt like I was witnessing something that I could not possibly explain, which made the hair stand up all over my neck and arms. I have recently taken a more keen look at the sky as I am currently enrolled in an astronomy class at the University of Kansas, and I have to say that witnessing these two objects was easily the most intriguing, confusing, and spookiest thing I have witnessed to date.",

No noise was heard.  A few seconds before the first flash, the kitchen table light blinked.  We counted at least 5 flashes with a few second intervals.

So, then I thought &ldquo;ok maybe it is a comet or meteor&rdquo; when suddenly what I saw it split into three white circles in a backwards &ldquo;L&rdquo; shape.  I was not too far from home, so I immediately called my dad and told him to go outside and face south. He saw what my boyfriend and I had seen, and then, it split into five circles. We were amazed and going crazy trying to figure out what it was. As we drove as far South as we could we noticed the five circles of light were vertically straight. Trees got in the way of my view, but when I managed to get another glimpse of it, it was horizontally straight. We saw a plane that appeared to be heading in the same direction and then it took a turn away from it. I am not sure it had to do anything with what we saw, but it seemed interesting. The five circle! s of light clustered a bit closer together and quickly faded out of sight.I did try to take pictures of these mysterious orbs in the sky in the duration of about ten minutes that this was going on, but my camera phone could not capture something at the distance of the lights, which I want to say was possibly twenty to thirty miles away. Relative to the size of full moon that was out at the time, I would say it was about one eighth of the size (and the moon was big and low around 1850 hours), or about three times the size of the North Star, or maybe even the size of a light bulb twenty to thirty feet away. I am sure more people had to see it if they were going south of Krome Avenue. This is not the first time I see something of this interest in the sky and I am certain that we are not alone.",

It kept falling and then split into two smaller burning fireballs and continued to fall.  Well before it hit the ground each meteor split into two orbs or lights (thus four total) and each light turned and travelled horizontal to the ground.  They were no longer falling.  We then noticed a fifth and all five were travelling at different speeds to the west.  We watched them fly for several minutes until they got so far we could no longer see them.  They did not fly in any formation and appeared to be travelling at different speeds and altitudes.  Next we noticed a second fireball that did the exact same thing.

The rear of the house is south facing. I waited outside the rear of the house expecting to see the object.  After 10 &ndash; 15 seconds, there was no sight of the orange glowing object so I went to the side of the house to see where it might have been.To my amazement I saw in total three objects of the same colour, two which were slightly less intense in luminescence.At this point I ran back into the house to get my binoculars and called my partner and two children.  We ran back through the house to the front door.From the front of the house, which is north facing, two of the objects changed to a different path, rising in the sky and losing their luminescence.  The third object continued on a south easterly track.I followed the remaining object through binoculars for 5-10 seconds and then went through to the back of the house where again I was able to track the object on a south easterly direction.The luminescence of the object faded as it continued south easterly direction.  I did not see this as unusual as it was heading in the direction of the location of the moon, not directly at the moon!.   However, I was able to continue to track the object as it moved into a south easterly direction while losing it&rsquo;s luminescence.I could not distinctly make out the shape of the object.What was additionally so unusual was there was no sound from the object(s).  Normally as aircraft pass over head their engine noise can be heard very distinctly.  However on this occasion there was no sound what so ever.",

We stopped to have something to eat before leaving, I was busy setting up things, but noticed that a red light appeared on a hill not far from us,and I also noticed that it turned off as quickly as it appeared I figured they found there campsite, and continued what I was doing. We finished eating when the red light appeared again on the hillside, and it also appeared to be throwing a white light against the side of the hill (headlights) but while that did not seem odd, this did it was moving horizontal along the side of this hill, but when it moved above the hill I begin to take notice. Now I am looking at two hills separated by a saddle, height of the hil! l#1  approximately 200&apos; sloping side&apos;s hill#2 same height, but only one side slope&apos;s down to 100&apos; hill&apos;s run east to west my location is 1/4 m north, sky is clear, temp 50&apos;s  The sun had set 20minutes earlier. The red light moves between the two hill&apos;s and separate&apos;s into three bright white sphere&apos;s they form abreast of each other and move in unison. At the base of hill#2 something totally different is happing, picture this 4 columns of red lights stacked one on top of other, like the warning lights on towers moving from right to left and in unison with what appeared to be white lights moving with the columns of red lights which look like the  head light of vehicles passing in front of some obstruction blinking effect, I thought that it was vehicles on hwy 14, but the hwy was some distance away, all this went on for about 30-40 minutes this was a performance for our enjoyment or just showing off! that is the only explanation I offer. the finale to this show was the 3 sphere! s reformed into 1 bright white sphere which turned 180&apos; toward! s us exp anded and brighten then simply blinked gone! This story is not finished. I decided that it would be prudent to pack up and leave, which is what we did. During the period of increased mining the need for a post office was met and one was constructed, the B.L.M. has restored the office as best they could, I noticed the building has we drove past it going  out of the valley.  We found the road which would take us to the highway and home, but something was wrong because instead of the highway we found the post office, again,and again, and again,and again, low fuel stopped the madness we decided to rest until morning. and when morning arrived I had parked 20&apos; from the post office again knowing this it still took more then an hour to find the trail the only trail out of that place all trails are marked by B.L.M. signs Well there it is I had ruled out Military because of the nature of the display there was no other persons in the general area, there was no sound these vehicles were! unidentified, and airborne objects (U.F.O.)",

As we were traveling north on route 95, we were driving about 60 mph and I observed a stationary light on the west side of the highway, about the height of one of the large powerline towers.   I thought to myself a powerline must cross the road there, and it was lighted for aircraft.  We were talking and driving, and as I approached where the light was (I could not see it without leaning foward and looking up) I noticed there was not a electical powerline tower there.  It was odd, and I leaned foward and looked up (as did my wife). We both observed a cylinder shaped object, about as long as a city bus suspended in air.  There was a window across the cylinder, and the window appeared to be at a 45 degree angle downward facing towards us.  There appeared to be a panel of somekind the entire length of the window.  There were figures seated at the panel across the length of the object, and what app! eared to be several figures standing behind them.  My wife and I both got the feeling the figures inside the objects were looking at us.  The interior of the object was illumintated, and we could see clearly inside.  As we passed, we were both surprised because the object appeared to be suspended in air.  I asked her if she wanted to turn around and go back, and she said yes.  I found a place to complete a U turn, and as we approached the object from the north a hundred yards away, it &quot;streaked off&quot; in a southeastern diretion towards Las Vegas, on an horizontal plane.

20100228,20100228," Tucson, AZ", triangle,:20 min,"Saw what appeared to be stars shooting &quot;laser&quot; lights down, also an object emitting other objects in to anotherI have seen the same things in the sky for over a year.  One night my dog  was extremely anxious and began to bark angrily and excessively at the back door. I was reluctant to get up and let her out as she had just been out. I had gotten off work late and was eating dinner at the table, my dog was going crazy (like when someone knocks on the door) I finally got up and took her out, she ran out with the hair on her back standing up. When I got outside to take a look around I looked and saw what I thought was the police chopper, It was a large light hovering pretty low. I went back inside to finish my dinner, however my dog continued to be very upset, so I went back outside to physically carry her back inside. When I went outside I stopped and watched what I originally thought was a police chopper, and as I watched I realized it was something else. The light seemed to grow in size and it shot a smaller &quot;star&quot; out and that star shot out and we watched it glide across the sky, ! it shot north and we watched it until we could no longer see it. It also appeared to have what looked like a streak of grey afterburner smoke under it.Naturally I called everyone I knew to tell them about what I had seen, my brother suggested that I keep my cell phone on me and try to get a picture of it, if it happened again. I decided that was a good idea. I never thought I would see anything like that again, however the next day I had my phone in my pocket, and my dog began to bark excitedly again. I ran outside and looked up and around for a while, then right above me  I spotted a red laser looking thing shooting out of what I thought was a star. At first I thought it was my imagination, but I put my cell phone on video and held my arm up for about half an hour and suddenly I actually saw it again and got it video taped on my cell phone. After that point in the days to come my dog continued to bark excitedly and sure enough when I go outside if I look up in the general direction where she is barking, I almost always get a shot of a &quot;star&quot; shooting a laser usually white sometimes blue and red only twice.  It  has been a! year and I probably have around 60 videos of these things. I can only surmise that they make a sound that we cannot hear but that my dog can hear. Aside from the &quot;stars that  shoot lasers, we also have videos of what looks like 5-6 &quot;stars&quot; and suddenly one &quot;star&quot; like light comes out of the bottom of one &quot;star&quot; and slowly goes up in to another. I keep referring to  the word &quot;star&quot; because if you do not know what you are looking for they just look like stars. It&apos;s my dog that hears or senses something that alerts me to something strange up there. Often times there are three &quot;stars&quot; in the shape of a triangle out there and the two bottom stars of the triangle shoot lasers.I  have been hesitant to report anything because I don&apos;t want to be classified as a crazy person, however I need to report to someone, I know what I have seen and what I have on video.I live in a town where there is a military base, and I sometimes wonder if they are experimenting with something, but I am tired of seeing things, I am tired of my dog getting so upset and I just want to know what these things are.

I had never met her friend before which made the night extremely weird. &quot;Hi nice to meet you, come check out this ufo in the sky!&quot;  My cousin, her boyfriend, and myself were standing out in the freezing cold last night smoking cigarettes and talking about life in general, when all three of us suddenly got silent and began questioning what was visually in front of us.  It was a bright white light high in the sky with six smaller lights blinking around it on both sides, six total.  There were only three other colors besides the white light in the middle.  RED BLUE GREEN, RED BLUE GREEN.  That was the pattern.  At times it would move farther away making it appear as one bright light.  Every few minutes it would begin to move around very slowly but then return to sitting still.  This took place for around two hours.  After I built up the ! self esteem to go inside and tell the others what I was witnessing thats exactly what happened.  They came outside and it only appeared to be a very bright star.  They began to laugh and give us funny looks when the light completely disappeared for three or four seconds only to reappear bright and flashing the pattern of multi-colored lights again.  We stayed outside observing for nearly three hours stunned in disbilief at what we were witnessing.  Im not saying it was a ufo I do not know what it was.  I am 22 years old and the five people with me were all between 22 and 26.  None of us have ever seen something like that before and when you witness something like that it is truly disturbing in a sense, it makes your spine tingle.  Shortly before the object went away two planes circled within the area of the object but would not get very close.

The unusual part was a few things, first, the four lights were not connected but if you focused in the lights you could see a faint light connecting all the lights together as if it were four lights on a string that would shift around as it moved through the sky.The second unusual part was that you could definitely see helicopters/airplanes following it like they were chasing it and as the helicopters/airplanes got closer the object would shift-shape and fly faster, i saw the object go from my left side of the car (north) to the front (east) to the right side (southwest) in less than a minute.Now it was not making any sounds that i could tell just the sounds of planes and helicopters.  The only reason that I would come to conclusion that this could be a ufo is that I had seen these same actions on two different tv shows at two different dates on the history channel in which these exact descriptions were portrayed; four lights appearing to be shape shifting starting as a v then turning into a straight line kind of like Orion&rsquo;s belt, but four lights, moving through the sky.

But you could still see them. When they were not glowing brightly I could make out what appeared to be a dark spot on the top what appeared to be an avoid shape as the sun reflected off of a dull metallic surface of each one.  The best way for me to describe the shape and color of the surface would be that each object appeared like an upside down brushed stainless steel cooking Wok.  Then in perfect unison, they would all glow white hot ! again, similar to what a high intensity headlamp would appear like.The most interesting thing about this formation, is that they all maintained separation from each other and did not appear to be moving in front or behind each other like a swarm of bees might appear like.

This is not in the standard flight path for the area for either civilian or military aircraft; there is no commercial flight path at this location.I work a short distance from home approximately 10 miles by road near the hwy 8 and 125. I observed at this location from 7am to 8:30 two aircraft making chemtrails traveling east to west, one was at a higher elevation, and you could see that it was an airplane but it was too high up to get details of the craft. The other plane was at a lower enough elevation to see the size and color of the plane, it had wing tips they were facing up, two jets motors on each wing, drab grey and black in color. You could not hear a jet exhaust noise from the airplanes.I observed 5 passes with this pattern; it would vary in respect to starting from southeast towards northwest and starting northeast towards southwest at the high and low elevations. I could not observe the whole incident, but I saw enough to know these facts to be accurate.  As a few minutes past I  found a vantage point to look at the sky again; I observed 11 chemtrails in the sky at varying heights going east to west and two from a more north to south west direction. I observed during two passes at the lower elevation after the &quot;cloud&quot; spread was starting, these planes had no chemtrails coming out of them.Slowly the chemtrails would spread out and the slight westerly breeze would push them east, you could see these &quot;cloud&quot; were stopping from the atmospheric pressure of the local mountains, so the chemtrails spread out from north to south. It appeared like there were several very, very long thin &quot;clouds&quot; stretching from east to west.By mid afternoon I could no longer feel the warm sun which I had from the morning or see bright blue sky. The sky was filled with a hazy looking &quot;cloud&quot; layer. Not any cloud I have seen, but a hazy white cover in the sky, with slight blue sky color penetrating through.As of this writing at 5:45pm PST there is still a white even haze in the sky, at my homes vantage point I can see normal puffy clouds behind the local Mt. Laguna to the east, which I see all the time as a normal weather pattern occurrence.These &quot;hazy clouds&quot; on the west side of Mount Laguna, were created from the trails of these military looking jet aircraft as I have described here. There is no round or puffiness shape to it, as with normal natural clouds, in regards to the hazy flat white layer created by these planes.",

Austin, a object with unusual lights was seen about 100 yards off of the interstate, hovering completely still about 300-400 feet in the air. The object had larger and more luminous lights than normal, with one steady blue light and one slowly blinking red light. The driver approached the object and it was completely stationary. First impression was that the object was some sort of tethered balloon with lights, but subsequent events ruled out this possibility. Upon passing underneath the object, driver noted that the body of the craft appeared to have a very unusual shape, possibly triangular, though it was difficult to see under the conditions. The object remained stationary for the duration that the driver could view it in the rear-view mirror.  Driver then made a u-turn on the interstate as soon as possible to return to the sight of the spotting. Upon returning approximately 2 minutes later, the craft was nowhere to be see! n, which was thought to be unusual since if it had been a hovering helicopter he would have expected to see it moving off into the distance.

I stopped my car and pulled over to the shoulder as I watched it slowly glide by without ANY sound at all I watched as it went over Fort Collins and out of sight.  It was on the news for only a brief time then no more was heard of it.  I immediately called my boss in Cheyenne and asked if he had seen anything .. He explained exactly what I had seen myself, so I know I wasn&apos;t seeing things.  Other vehicles had pulled over in both my lane and the oncoming lanes, as well.  I know of nothing both civilian or military that emits sparks like that, (beautiful colors and very bright as well) that can make zero noise and had no semblance of any cockpit that one could see, it was that close to the ground..  I approximate it&apos;s airspeed at around 100 knots because I could easily watch it as it came into close view and then went by and then watched as it went out of sight again..  It was said, I think, on the news that it was some type of military aircraft that went down.  Might have crashed somewhere South of Loveland, Colorado or Longmont...  Not sure exactly.

We were enjoying an evening of surf fishing, but not catching much of anything.  The weather was warm, and the sky was mostly clear with only a few thin, sparse, low lying clouds, and a full moon.  Standing on Holden Beach, NC looking at the ocean you are facing south.  We saw the light to our left a bit, in a south easterly direction.  I estimate it to have been approximately 25 or 30 degrees above the horizon, and most definitely over the ocean.  I did not notice the time when we saw it, but I estimate it to be sometime between 9:30 and 10:30 pm.What we saw that night was a huge, sort of light-orange, maybe even amber light.  It was not a perfect circle, but rather it was a kind of very soft, square shape with long, sweeping, rounded corners.  The first time I saw it, it appeared for only a few seconds, then faded out.  I asked my sons if they saw it, but they did not.  I told them what I saw and where I saw it, and, of course, they got a kick out of picking on the old man for &ldquo;seeing things&rdquo;.  After what seemed to be about 4 or 5 minutes it appeared again, for only a few seconds before fading out again.  We all three saw it this time, and the next two times that followed.  After about 8 or 10 minutes it appeared again, and again for only a few seconds before fading out for about 15 or 20 minutes.  It reappeared once more for a few seconds, faded out one last time, and that was the last time we saw it.The light maintained the same altitude and exact location in the sky during the entire observation.  I used the end of channel marker light from the Lockwood Folly Inlet, and the Oak Island Light House Beacon as my landmarks for pinpointing the light.  At first I questioned whether it was possibly a ships flare, but there is no way it could have been.  It was too high, too big, and did not fluctuate at all in its position or attitude.I did some research before deciding to file this report.  I know we saw it, and I know it was not an airplane, helicopter, blimp, or anything else I have ever seen in my life time.  I am not 100% convinced, however, that it was anything out of the natural realm.

20100305,20100305," Bangalore (India),", unknown,2-3 minutes,"At the outset, I would like to make it clear that at the time of the sighting, I had scant knowledge of the internet (way back in 2001) and was not aware of the existence of a UFO report centre, whether online or offline. I was 16 years old and was studying in the second year of college. I do remember that I recorded the EXACT date and time of the sighting along with a verbal description of the nature of the UFO, but cannot find the original record anywhere. I also wish to state that the reason I am submitting this report is because of a second sighting I made barely a week ago, in the same country but a different city hundreds of miles away from the first and a full nine years later. I am 24 years old and havehad two sightings in my life thus far.Situation and description:  It was summer and I was on the terrace at our place in Bangalore, India, at around seven in the evening.  My brother had just headed back downstairs and I lingered on for a while longer as the weather was pleasant.  I lay down on the ground and stared at the sky star gazing. I don&rsquo;t remember which constellation I was looking at exactly, but I spotted a bright shining light from the corner of my eye, a little distance away from the spot I was looking at.   As I first looked at it I thought it was a star because that&rsquo;s exactly what it appeared to be (almost as bright as Sirius). Then I realized it was moving, albeit very slowly, to the right.   As I watched it suddenly seemed to accelerate for a while before stopping abruptly and changing direction at an angle of ninety degrees.  I sat up as I thought my eyes were tricking me, but the object did not stop and was definitely not an illusion or a trick of light.  It stood out against the pitch black sky, which ! I thought was remarkable considering Bangalore&rsquo;s light pollution.  The object continued to zig-zag along a roughly linear axis,and it was this zig-zag motion at high speed that amazed me for I have never seen an aircraft capable of such abrupt change of direction at such high speeds before.  As it proceeded along its path it changed seemed to me it was changing colour, from the dull yellow, starlike tinge it originally had(at least when I spotted it) to blue and finally to a dull green flicker.  This &lsquo;phenomenon&rsquo; lasted for a good couple of minutes, disappearing behind the silhouette of the taller building next to our own for some twenty-thirty seconds before reappearing on the other side.  It then disappeared in a matter of moments, with the intensity of light decreasing to zero and vanishing. This was all I saw.I have seen weather balloons before, and I am absolutely certain what I saw was no such thing for without adequate propulsion I think it is impossible to move as rigidly and discretely as this body did.  Same reasoning also rules out any form of burning/incandescent matter floating toward the earth.  As for the object itself I know absolutely nothing of its form, shape or even size because all I saw was a bright spot of light.  Curiously enough, this was a few months after news of the Mir space station&rsquo;s &lsquo;demise&rsquo; and its break-up in the atmosphere.  Clearly this had nothing to do with the &lsquo;sighting&rsquo;, in my opinion, considering the time-gap between the two events and the obvious impossibility of debris acquiring wings of its own and flying about.  Also, there is an air-force base in Bangalore, but I enquired about and have been told Indian Airforce crafts are NOT allowed to fly over the city airspace. And in any case I know India isn&rsquo;t capable of such &lsquo;top-secret&rsquo; flight testing programmes, yet.I have no choice but to brand this sighting an UFO.((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.

However, after I stopped walking to get a better look at the object, I realized that it wasn&apos;t moving, but rather drifting ever so slowly, and at times, it would remain stationary.  I stood staring at the object for a number of minutes trying to decipher what it was that I was looking at.  I thought to myself, is that a balloon?  I just couldn&apos;t figure out what it was that I was looking at.  It was just a sizable black object high in the sky, about the size of an aircraft, but shapeless.  It didn&apos;t make a noise, or have any lights, but it did seem to have a whitish hue or ambience to it at times.  After a number of minutes staring at the sky, I said to myself, I must look ridiculous, so I decided to move on, not to mention that my dog was ge! tting very impatient.  I probably wouldn&apos;t have thought much more about it, but what happened next is what dictated that I report it.  I looked away for only a second or two, probably took three or four steps, and then glanced back up at it, but it was gone.  It simply disappeared.  I immediately stopped again and stared in disbelief.  It was nowhere to be seen.  There were planes flying all over the place, but no black object.  I searched the sky for a number of minutes, but it was gone.  That&apos;s when I started to question the reality of what I just witnessed.  What did I see?  There has to be a rational explanation.",

After the event it seemed to take about ten min. to get into Kettleman City, traveling on Highway 41.  If the direction of the road that we were on was 12 o&apos;clock, the lights were at about 12:30. The lights were in a triangle position with equal distance between, if they were connected on the perimeter.  There were seven lights that were red and that did not blink like an airplane.  The lights then began to move an incredible distance in a short amount of time, going from the 12:30 position, to the 2:30 position within 5 seconds, and then stops.  It seemed 20 miles off now, and about 10 times closer than when first spotted with the lights in the same formation.  We then pulled over off the road to try to get video on the cell phone and that is when it elevates straight up, what had to be a couple of miles, stops for 2 seconds, and ! then accelerates off at about 3 o&apos;clock until the lights faded out within 2 or 3 sec.  It seemed odd that before we got back on the road after about 2 min., that no cars passed by us.  It was odd because about two miles before we saw the lights, we passed two slower moving cars going in our direction.I drew a picture of the lights when i got home. If you want to contact me i could fax the drawing. I told two people i trust the most about this and I&apos;m not bringing it up again.

The first was when I was studying in Bangalore, India, in 2001. This is the second one and occurred about a week ago at my current location, Hyderabad, India. I was on the terrace of our place resting on an arm-chair. The only reason I was even looking up at the sky was because of the angle at which the armchair reclined. I noticed a bright light in the western horizon, and as it was still twilight the object was the only &lsquo;star&rsquo; I saw in the sky.  Even as I watched , it suddenly seemed to grow in size and intensity, moved &lsquo;up&rsquo; in a way that I cannot really put into words (a sort of beaming, if you will) for a little distance at normal speed, then disappeared abruptly. I tried to figure out what it could have been, but so far no logical explanation has seemed good enough, to me.

20100305,20100305," Tacoma, WA", fireball,2 minutes,"Fireball over Tacoma Wa.I witnessed a gently pulsating (~4 Second Intervals) orange light/fireball moving due north over Tacoma, Washington at a constant angle of about 70 degrees above the western horizon.  Though I could not judge the distance or altitude well, the &ldquo;apparent and relative&rdquo; speed and size was like that of a landing light from a military airplane or the International Space Station at it&rsquo;s brightest passing overhead.  It was noticeably brighter and slightly larger than a planet or bright star but I noted no atmospheric aberration giving the sensation that it was a small object moving by at a close distance (a few hundred feet away).  This struck me as bizarre because my logic dictated that the object, like an aircraft at that motion, should be a mile or two away.  At one point, the object began to slowly undulate and decelerated to a stop within about five seconds, then emitted an apparently solid &ldquo;column&rdquo; of light from the bottom.  The light column did not continue ! downward to the ground, but ceased in mid-air about two to three degrees below the object.  Also, this emitted light was shimmering with several colors (ie. Purple, green, white), and was minor in magnitude in comparison to the luminosity of the main object body and was relatively difficult to see clearly.  After about ten seconds, the light column and fireball disappeared and in it&rsquo;s place began a bright white and random strobe pattern.  The object then accelerated to the north again, achieving extremely high apparent speed until it disappeared from view down near the north horizon.  (I had just enough time to run upstairs from my south side downstairs porch to see the last few seconds of it passing into the distance from my north-facing second-story kitchen window).  I also noted that the light portion of the blinking interval cycle was very fast or &ldquo;instantaneous&rdquo; compared with strobe lights that I had seen before this.  Total U.F.O. observation time was about two minute! s, and lastly, there was no noticeable sound coming from the o! bject th roughout the sighting. I have lived near a major US Air Force base my entire life and have spent 34 years around many different aircraft of which I feel that I have become very familiar.  This object, which I only passively noticed far in the distance from the corner of my eye, very quickly struck me as odd and out of place.  I had a strong feeling that this object, if not a human-piloted or controlled craft, definitely exhibited signs of intelligence or intelligent control, possibly even aware of my observing it.

20100306,20100306," Kihei, HI", circle,15 minutes,"6 yr-old daughter and Mom spotted 4 spaceships in a large cloud on a clear Hawaii night.I was driving south at approximately 8:45 PM on March 5, 2010, and my 6-yr-old daughter was in the passenger seat, singing a song. Suddenly she stopped singing and because of the sudden quiet she emitted, as a Mom, it sort of startled me. But I was driving on a busy highway and concentrated on the road instead of attending to her. After about 10 seconds she finally expressed a sound (she&apos;d been staring intently out the window). She said: &quot;Oh, wow&quot; or something similar and that she was watching a UFO!   Of course my initial reaction was to totally dismiss it, like she was being childish and I told her there was no such thing, it was just twinkling in the stars.  In Hawaii, of course, the clear night sky is utterly spectacular and pristine. I never glanced in her direction and we talked about space for the remainder of the ride.We pulled into our apartment complex&apos;s parking lot, about 5-10 minutes later and we both got out of the car.  I still needed to get my 2 yr-old out of the car, who was sitting in a car seat in the back, but something made me look up in the sky first.  The sky was completely sparkling clean with no clouds.   Directly above us I saw a large cloud with a bunch of multiple dancing lights inside, as if someone was projecting a light show into a cloud.  My 6 yr-old can describe it more accurately since she watched it longer than I did. I couldn&apos;t believe what I saw.  It didn&apos;t make any logical sense. A lot of my mental energy went into attempting to process the meaning of it all, as I was watching it.  The only possible explanation I could think of, was that a big light show was happening on the beach about 100 feet below me and being projected into a cloud.  The lights were dancing quickly and there were many lights, like a show.  The only other answer was that it was a UFO.My 6 yr-old&apos;s description, is better since I needed to attend to my 2 yr-old abruptly:  She said it was 3 to 4 circles of lights (like a craft) in the transparent cloud (the cloud reminded me of the material a ghost would be made out of, invisible, yet, not invisible).  When my daughter initially saw the thing in the car she said the circles, were dancing around in circles really fast, going first, clockwise and then, counter clockwise, in rhythmic motion.  Later, when we saw it in the parking lot, the lights changed movement and direction: blinking sort of haphazardly but with purpose, not clumsy, and not going in just circles any more and they were &quot;dancing&quot; quickly.  To me, &quot;dancing lights&quot; fits well because the &quot;feeling&quot; I received was that of a kind of rhythmic motion and almost celebratory, as if a light &quot;show&quot; was taking place. My daughter saw the lights as: about, 4 circular crafts, with fast blinking lights.Neither my daughter nor I could &quot;believe&quot; what we saw, we kept rubbing our eyes to see if our vision was messed up, but it wasn&apos;t, it was real!   I&apos;d turned to retrieve my 2-yr-old daughter out of the car and proceeded to discard of some rubbish in a nearby trash can, and the thing had totally dematerialized! My 6 yr-old hadn&apos;t seen it vanish, either, for she had looked away momentarily, too.The weirdest disappearing aspect, was the fact, the wispy cloud the lights had been projecting from, was gone, as well.  Not a trace of a cloud was left in the sky.",

I stayed at my sister&rsquo;s apartment while my car was being fixed last week.  On Friday, I got my car out of the shop but decided to stay at my sister&rsquo;s to watch movies.  However, first I wanted to come home to feed my dogs and wash clothes.  These would take some time as I live deep in the country in Arkansas, near Memphis.  It usually takes me at least 15 mins. to reach my house from my sister&rsquo;s apartment.I came home around 5-5:30, during dusk, and noticed this weird shape in the sky that did not move.  I didn&rsquo;t think about it for long due to the fact it was kind of far away.  I came home, did my chores, and left for my sister&rsquo;s apartment.  After watching movies (2012 and Zombieland), I started for home around 1 in the morning.  As I got closer to my house, I realized there was this strange light in the sky around a field.   Once again, I didn&rsquo;t really pay attention.  I thought it was a lamppost.As I rounding the third curve, I saw the light right above the field near the Waverly Gin.  This really freaked me out.  I was the only car on the road, in the country, near a field.  I thought for sure this thing was a helicopter, crop duster, you know just trying to rationalize what I was seeing.  When I got to the curve where the Gin and field were, I started to slow down.  As I slowed, I literally saw a disk like shape with one light, like a flood, search light looking-thing, and two red lights on the side.  I rolled the window down to hear, you know, if this was a helicopter or what, and I heard nothing.I seemed to be hovering over a line of trees about 100 feet away.  When I slowed down, I sat there for about 30 seconds to figure out what this thing was.  As I sat there, I started to see it coming closer to me.  I freaked out and tried to get as far away as possible from this thing.  It started to follow me and did so for about a mile.  I started to look at the clock and at the road, a little back and forth motion, to make sure I was still at the right time.  I remember the time was 1:45 the last time I looked at the clock in the car.  After I rounded curve number 5, I was no more than a few hundred feet from my house and looked in the review mirror, out the sun roof, and both side mirrors and saw nothing.When I pulled up to my house, the next thing I noticed was the neighbor&rsquo;s outdoor lights didn&rsquo;t come on when my dogs ran into his yard barking insanely.  So that started to weird me out.  I sat in the car for 5 mins. looking everywhere I could outside my car to see if something was around, above, behind, or anywhere near.  I got out and tried to peek above the trees to see if I could see whatever it was I had just encountered.  I saw nothing.

Then the object appeared to start changing shape the lights started moving from edge to center still spinning counter clockwise.  I held my hand up to try to judge the size touching my thumb to my index finger (making an ok jester) the object fit in there (probably the size of a fifty cent piece).  I reached back to open the door and yelled for my wife to come out.  She did, but the lights were already out of her sight, I could still see them, and it made a 90degree turn directly west.

The ball and the tail disappeared following a bright flash of light.  I was in the midst of approximately 20 cars, and I could tell they had seen it to because everyone braked at the same time.

As the light moved east, I compared the brightness of it to the surrounding stars and it was brighter than the brightest stars in my field of vision.

I also looked for any flashing lights around the white light and did not see any.I quickly stepped back in the house and asked my wife to come outside to see this light.  I stepped out side again and the light began to fade quickly.  My wife did not make it outside fast enough to see it.  The light went from bright white to undetectable in about 3 seconds.  At that point, I would estimate this object was over Puget Sound.I could not judge the altitude except to say it seemed to be at least 30 thousand feet overhead.

I watched for a few minutes but saw nothing else and went back to the dog walking thing. After several minutes I turned around and looked at the spot where I had seen the flashes and saw a large ball of light that I at first thought was a star. Then it became clear this was not a star and was blinking. The blinking reminded me of a old rotating police light. The light was white and I could see flashes of blue or green in it. There was another smaller blinking light underneath and to the west of the larger light that wa! s moving very slowly as if it were searching for something. I walked back to the house and continued to watch the lights and got my mom to come outside and look. She agreed that the lights were odd and did not look like any aircraft.

After that I came inside and uploaded the pics onto my computer and was amazed to find several round sphere&rsquo;s a long ways up over my House. So, I zoomed in the pic and there was this disc looking sphere, greenish on the center and fuzzy white around the outside. It also appeared to have area&rsquo;s of exhaust coming from several spots around the orb.The following night December 26, 2009, I took about 50 or 60 more pics and was again surprised to see many more of these round muti-colored orbs. There appeared to be human-like occupants inside the craft, I could tell because these things are transparent. Today is March 7,2010 , every single night since then I have seen MANY different size and shaped crafts, several of them appear to be VERY large. In the photo&rsquo;s you can see people inside, also what appears to be computer terminals and flat screens, with people sitting or standing around them. Also, you can see what looks to be  ( plasma warp drive&rsquo;s) or something. I have seen these on clear nights, cloudy night s, in the rain, in the snow. One time I was observing a couple of them hovering way up overhead, and it seemed as soon as I took a picture and my flash went off, they took off, it looked like a shooting star, it took off so fast, my brother happened to be standing outside with me during one of these events. I can go outside on any given night and capture these things on camera, sometimes I have to take a couple pics, then its as though the flash attracts them and then there&rsquo;s anywhere from 1 - 20,30 of them. I have many pictures, I haven&rsquo;t really wanted to report them because there is such a stigma attached to this topic.

My peripheral vision picked up a low-flying airplane above the freeway, which caught my interest. As I looked to examine it, I noticed it was not an airplane but a darkly-colored (black or dark grey) saucer-shaped object that was moving at what seemed to be a low speed and at what seemed to be a low altitude. It was difficult to tell, as my car was moving past it at 70 mph in the opposite direction, but the craft appeared to be travelling somewhere between 40-70 mph, going north, and only a few hundred feet off the ground.  This would have made the object itself a bit smaller than an airplane, although it is too difficult to estimate a size. What was then even more interesting was a blue light that emitted from the side wall of the craft, moving in a circle around the ! craft, looking a bit like a reflection from a glass wall, but perhaps coming from within the craft. It was then that I really thought I&apos;d seen a U.F.O.I had never seen one before, and I still have my doubts about this one.  The craft was spotted in a densely populated urban area, not far from Disneyland and many other world-famous entertainment spectacles, and it may simply have been coming from or going to one of those places.  But for the five seconds I had to witness it, the craft truly did not look human to me.

It banks to the east and slowly heads away.  Speed wise it was moving about half of what the commercial jets in the area  appeared to be.  When I pointed it out to my friend his first statement was the same as mine &quot;what in the hell is that&quot;.  We quickly called the rest of our family from inside to come out.

I immediately said, ((deleted)), look a shooting star and i saw her smile at first but then when it stopped we both were shocked. the ball of light got a little brighter then changed direction and shot into outer space with a white trail behind it at an unimaginable speed and not once did it make a sound. my jaw literally dropped and my girlfriend face was in shock with a gasp that you only hear when you are surprised beyond belief. it was so bright that it not only caught our eye at the same time but we think the 2 cars behind us also. the reason i say this is because after the six seconds we watched this thing shoot in and then leave, i had to be sitting at that traffic light for about another 10 seconds....and anyone in the north jersey area can tell you ! people around here have zero patience when it comes to sitting at a green traffic light....and not one horn was blown at me during this time. It was so crazy that i had to pull over shortly after leaving the traffic light because i was literally shaking. i felt confused, scared, LIED TO, and relieved all at the same time.  Even my friends who are all skeptics about everything, Especially UFO&apos;s, Ghosts, etc., even they admitted that my story sounds crazy, but to have an eye witness who was sitting right next to me who&apos;s story matched exactly, overwhelmed even them. the part that really puts an image that they cant help but to feel something is the part about how it shot into outer space with the white trail following. the best way to describe it is someone hitting homerun with a lightbulb into the air at a million miles per hour , and it never came down nor made a sound.",

I of course panicked, and then when it turned, and I noticed the underside, which had a red light on the back, which came to a point, similar to a triangle, I pulled out my cell phone and took a picture just before it went over the houses towards Wal-Mart and Mt. Holly Springs.The picture I took is at http://i187.photobucket.com/albums/x262/gothghost2/Locked/ufo.jpg and shows the large red light, several smaller red lights that were on the side, and one of the large, round white lights on the front. The picture is bad quality because it&rsquo;s dark, but the lights on the object were very bright and can be seen somewhat clearly.I have no clue what this thing was, but there is an Army War College in town and a nearby Navy Depo., however this didn&rsquo;t seem to be military made seeing as how it was maybe only as high as a ten story building and seemed to smoothly hover, did not make noise, and was extremely large. There was a school bus outside of the YMCA that had lost all of its internal and external lights and power, but I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s connected or not, as nothing else lost power.",

It looked like a star and was very very very high up. It could have been misinterpreted as a meteor, but it stopped all of a sudden.  I ran inside to get the binoculars and when I got back out, I looked at the object again.  It just looked like a larger white orb of light, just slightly larger than a star.  Then another one showed up. My dad was saying, &ldquo;see that! See that!!&rdquo; Then one backed up a bit and the then the other one did as well.

It was at about a 70 degree angle at about 11 o&apos;clock or slightly to the left. I was up on a hill overlooking a small flood plain and watched it until it crossed over the horizon passing through the first hint of dawn.I would have reported this sooner but mistakenly thought that I had found an explanation. Since it went on a straight path and did none of the spectacular maneuvers UFOs are famous for I thought it might be an unusually bright satellite. Research showed that a certain kind could be as bright as Venus and decided that that was the most likely explanation. I have, however, since read that this type, the name of which presently escapes me, will only briefly appear that large and that it will quickly resume appearing the size of a normal satellite once it flashes. Since this one retained is brightness and size for the duration I think I may well have spotted a genuine UFO.((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

And no, this report is not intended as a joke or hoax.They say simply that they saw trapezoid shaped object with clearly distinct multicolored lights momentarily turning on and off while the object was comming from starboard (meaning from their right side facing front) and going in a generaly port direction (to their left) while making sharp right angle turns and &quot;whipping in different directions&quot; that&apos;s exactly the way they described it&apos;s movement ... They estimated it&apos;s size to be comparable to a typical 737 type passenger jet airliner and it was at a consistantly continuous altitude of several thousand feet above the ground (close to the same height as a airliner usually is in that area). They both insist that it could not be a reflection because they actually pulled to the right hand shoulder of the road and watched the thing go by. They say that no other vehicles were passing by in either direction when they were stopped. Unfortunately in addition to having no other witnesses to their account they do not have any phy! sical evidence of it either (photo&apos;s or anything else). There location where they pulled over was just in between the camp Kilmer U.S. Army reserve center and a small strip mall.

20100312,20100312," North Hollywood, CA",,,"instant black out and sudden bright light in the skyHello, earlier today on March 12, 2010 around 11am I spoke with someone over the phone at your center regarding what I saw yesterday on March 11, 2010 around 8:30-9:00 pm.  I was parked on the street by myself waiting for my sister to come out of my mother&rsquo;s house because I was picking her up. The street lights were on, and nobody was out on the street. While I was sitting there waiting for my sister to come outside, I experienced something that was very unusual and strange.  I saw everything turn pitch black and the sky turn into a bright light. I know it doesn&rsquo;t sound like something out of the ordinary but trust me it was. I keep replaying it in my head and it just doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to me. The best way that I can describe it is like a sudden and instant flash.  The thing that made me wonder if it could be linked to something abnormal is because when the incident was occurring I saw the sky and it was like nothing like I have ever seen before.  The whole entire sky turned as if it were daylight for a split second, while everything else was blackened.  After the incident happened, I kept replaying it over my head and tried to make logical sense out of it, but nothing seemed to add up.  Then I started to look around me to see if anyone else saw what I had just seen, but there was not a soul.  Since I was on my own, it did cross my mind that perhaps it was my imagination but then my sister came out about a minute later and casually asked me if I had seen a flash or if it was just her.  Without me even mentioning anything to her.  When she asked me that, I knew that it wasn&rsquo;t my imagination anymore, it was far more than that and that this actually did happen.  I am just confused on what I did see because it was honestly something very strange and unusual.  I am not trying to conclude that this can be something related to aliens but I am curious to know if you guys can give me any sort of information regarding this.",

20100313,20100313," Bonita Springs, FL", sphere,5-8 minutes,"High altitude amber balls of light move across sky then appear to leave atmosphere above Bonita Springs, FL.I am a 20-year-old college student, and I live in Bonita Springs, FL. I work as a waiter and a carpenter and go to school as well. I understand the skepticism regarding UFOs. I accept the existence of aliens as extremely likely, but I recognize that there are people who misidentify things they see or falsify reports for attention or other personal gains. This is where my skepticism lies; not in the subject of UFOs, but those who report them. This may seem ironic as I myself am reporting a sighting, but my hope is that this report will not be disregarded. I have neither a desire nor motive to claim to see something I did not. That being said, I do wear contact lenses and had them in during the sighting. I was not under the influence of alcohol, tobacco, or any other drug with the exception of caffeine as I had a cup of coffee about ten minutes before the sighting occurred. What I witnessed occurred for approximately five minutes at 8:10 pm in the eastern sky. There was not a cloud in the sky and the stars were visible in all directions. At about 8:00 pm I finished my cup of coffee and then took my dog for a walk. A couple of minutes into my walk, I saw a shooting star in the southern sky as I was about to turn left (to the east) onto another street. This got my attention, and I began to observe the night sky in hopes of possibly seeing another.  Now heading east, I continued walking, periodically scanning the sky. It was after another few minutes that I first noticed an amber ball of light, which struck me as being at a very high altitude, moving from south to north across the sky. It was about 45 degrees above the horizon at first, but then it turned to the east while slowly climbing degree by degree above the horizon, getting smaller and smaller. It appeared to me that this light had turned away from me and was gaining more and more altitude. It began to twinkle, much like a star, as it got smaller and smaller until I could no longer see it. I continued walking east down the street and checking the area of the sky for another minute until I reached the point at which I normally turn around. Seeing nothing where the light was, I turned around and began walking to the west. About a minute later I stopped and turned around and looked to the area of the sky where I had seen the amber speck of light. I observed a second moving in the same south to north fashion as the first at about the altitude. I watched it briefly until a car was coming and I turned back around. A few seconds later looked back again and could not locate the light which I attribute to a nearby street light. I continued walking west. I checked the sky over my shoulder three more times as I walked, and on the third scan I saw a third light. It too was the same amber color as the first two, but it was moving away from me to the east, and climbing degree by degree above the horizon as it did so. I feel this was a spate light from the second as this one was more to the right (south) in the sky than the first two were. Again my impression was that this light was both gaining altitude and moving away from me, getting smaller and smaller.  There was no street light nearby, so I was able to observe this light for the longest before I could no longer see it. As it got very small, it emitted a single pulse of white light which was much larger and more intense than the amber ball itself. The ball then rapidly became extremely tiny in the sky, twinkling until I could see it off and on for a short while then not at all. Only after the balls were gone did I notice other aircraft flying in the sky, mainly because this is when I looked for them. I saw several, all much closer to the horizon than the amber balls were, and they were all equipped with strobe and running lights. Three in particular caught my attention. They were headed to the east and appeared to by flying in a widely spaced diagonal line formation. Whether or not they were military I do not know, but that was my initial impression. These balls of amber lights and the pulse of white light emitted by one are beyond my identification. I do not believe they were ball lightning as the sky was perfectly clear. My theory is that the lights I observed were those given off by the method of propulsion used by alien craft. This is only my best guess however, and while I do realize there may be other explanations, I could not think of one that fits to what I saw.",

The Street is called Lake shore blvd.We walked across the street while my dad stayed on our porch.They stayed in one spot for a long time. Sometimes they would appear to get closer. I remember being ready to run if it got to close..lol.  While one stayed still the other one started moving way over us.  My dad watched it as it passed over him. completely silent.  At this time it was pretty high up there. I don&apos;t know if I can give you an accurate measurement.  It went up into the sky completely vanishing out of site.  The other light. My memory has faded some on this.I think it to disappeared somewhere over the lake.  I think our sighting might of been in the summer. I&apos;m Most certian they were NOT helicopters.As I said.  They were both completely silent.I found a story UFO story online that happened in 1988 which could be related to what I saw because its close to the same year.  The UFO story happened in Eastlake Ohio which is the city right next to me.  I would also like to post a link to a YOUTUBE video I posted that is from another UFO spotted over Lake Erie in the city of Euclid Ohio. which is another city close to me.

20100313,20100313," Tukwila, WA", light,90 sec,"bright light travels over Seattle and seems to fade off into nothing.Upon pulling into my driveway on the evening of March 12th, 2010, at approximately 7:10pm, I exited my truck and looked up into the sky as usual. I am an amateur stargazer so my eyes are always to the sky. As I looked to the North I noticed a bright light moving across the sky, I would say about 40 degrees or so off the horizon. It was moving from West to East, inside the atmosphere. No flashes, no strobing, just a single white light, much brighter than any stars in the sky.After watching for about 30 seconds, I had determined that is clearly not a plane or a satellite. I couldn&apos;t believe my eyes, I ran to the front door and got my mother. She couldn&apos;t believe her eyes. We continued to watch for about another minute as it seemed to travel in short spurts (like an inch across the sky to the naked eye, if that makes sense). It continued on and seemed as if it just suddenly got bright and seemed to be stationary for a brief second and then slowly faded away.While watching all this 2 planes passed into our sites, so we could easily compare them to an airplane. My mother also is a stargazer and we used to look for satellites in the sky together when I was a child. I am now 32 and she is 55. I am also a full-time college student (as well, as I just completed a quarter in Astronomy), part-time risk engineer assistant and a single mother of 2 toddlers. my mother is a registered nurse.We are both sober, intelligent adults. I guess you could consider my mother a skeptic, she was quite amazed and really could not give an explaination for what she saw, nor could I. I am far from a skeptic and have had other experiences in the past. This is the first time I&apos;ve been able to share the phenomon with someone else. I hope someone else out there saw it too.",

I ignored it and was about to go to sleep when my dad walked up the stairs and asked if we had been messing around with a strobe light.He then thought that maybe a police helicopter or swat team was searching for somebody. It was then we all concurred that we saw something extremely odd. We all walked toward the window and then again, this time only about 5 seconds, and it vanished. We could see nothing else in the sky because the whole sky lighted up, but the beam branched out to concentrate in out attic.We have never seen anything like that before or since.

Eventually, a group of about 20 persons in a large apartment complex gathered to witness these movements.First some background explanations, the witness used the term &ldquo;low&rdquo; to mean that the orange objects were larger than the stars in the sky, so the witness felt like they were at a lower level.  These objects were not close to ground level.  Also, the apartment complex pool is used as a reference point to describe the movement of these far. way objects The witness reported that initially 3-4 objects that looked like the color of fire were coming in &ldquo;low&rdquo;, moving from south to north. Then one orange circular object broke away this initial group.  This single orange object moved further north until it was seen over the apartment complex pool.  Then, after a few seconds that object disappeared. During this time, the witness said &ldquo;little by little&rdquo; other orange objects kept moving from the south to north, and when they got by the pool they disappeared. The approximate viewing time was said to be 15 minutes Then the sky was clear. The witness guessed there were more than 20 orange objects, but not more than 40.Approximately 20 people in the complex saw these orange objects.  Many were out because they were smoking.  They attracted more viewers because they were saying loudly, &ldquo;Look up in the sky!&rdquo;.  The witness went outside because the dog was barking and upon checking outside the apartment the third time the witness saw this group of people looking orange objects in the sky.It was reported from another person in the apartment complex that the emergency phone number 911 was called. The 911 operator was reported as saying that a massive amount of calls were received from all over.  Some of the questions asked by the 911 operator were:  &ldquo;Was anything burning?   Did it hit anything?  Where did it come from?&rdquo;  It was also reported that the 911 operator said  that a request would be put out for cars out investigate.",

20100314,20100314," East Dundee, IL", triangle,15-20 seconds,"I clearly saw a triangle craft that glided overhead and changed the electricity of the air, but it was hard to focus on.I was walking down the bike path when it was dark out, I was going down to the Dairy Queen to meet a friend, my ride.  On my way to the path, I saw something strange moving through the air, I could barely tell what it was and I incorrectly (or maybe correctly) thought I saw a UFO. I concluded that it was just a plane but there were more lights in the sky around. I&apos;m about 45 min from Ohare so I know that my area has some looparound flight paths near it, and there seemed to be a ton of planes circling, you could almost always see one or two along a path at any given time or place (even later at the coffee shop many miles away there were still planes everywhere in the sky.)  There may be some back up because of the weather, it seemed like a storm is brewing in the air.  But on my way down the path, I saw another light in the distance, in a different direction that seemed... out of place. Once I got to where I could see clearly, it already had enough time to leave! . I kept on walking and about five minutes later I felt something change in the air. It was like the atmosphere had changed yet I was not consciously aware of it yet. It was more like instinct that made me turn my head, and I&apos;m glad I did. I saw something strange looking come out of the area behind me and to my left. It was a collection of three lights and one blinking one. I would have thought it was another plane except it seemed different, something felt wrong about it. As it passed over me, it took about 15-25 sec to pass from the horizon to my back left to the front right, I saw what it was. It was very hard to focus on it or to look at what it was. It felt like, consciously, I could only observe my surroundings instead of rationally comprehend or pick apart details. I know what I saw but it was hard to get anything to register, I couldn&apos;t pick it apart like I could shapes in a cloud. It was hard to see but it was only a few hundred feet above me, it was triangular and! had large lobed sides. It seemed outlined in something glowin! g white or translucent but shrouded as to not be too showy. As it passed I could see that there was something on the bottom, I&apos;m not sure if it was energy pads or whatever that was the light, but I could tell it was not an airplane, it was low enough to see, but still high up. The memory is a little hard to remember of how exactly it looked, like I said, it seemed hard to focus on. As it was going into the distance I noticed it was in a new shape. The triangle seemed to turn into a T shape of disconnected lights but I never saw he conversion, only before and after. That may have been due to distance, but I do have pretty good eyesight and don&apos;t often make up shapes like that. As it passed a few hundred feet over me, it wasn&apos;t loud. It sounded like it was a jet that was much much further up, but even that sound seemed... artificial. As if it was something that would not be noticed in the background of air traffic noise, but when looked at sounded... off. And the object was much too c! lose to have normally been that quiet, if a jet was that low, car alarms would be going off and the ground rumbling. As it glided over me, for I was in the center of a very small village with noone else around as far as I could see, the hum of the electricity seemed to temporarily change. I don&apos;t remember if the frequencies got higher or lower but I remember hearing a distinct change that only happened as it was passing over the building that had neon signs. What&apos;s odd is that I tried to tell the friends I hung out with multiple times about the sighting but no matter how hard I tried, the conversation would always get wildly diverted. I tried, but I couldn&apos;t slip it in in the few hours we were at Caribou Coffee. Even when I would do my best to specifically bring it up, the person I was trying to tell, the UFO junkie, kept suddenly getting compelled to finish a thought from 20, 30 minutes earlier in conversation. I could get not get a word about that in edgewise, even though! if I blatantly said I saw a UFO we would have been talking ab! out it a ll night. As I walked home from Denny&apos;s (yes, too many different restaurants,) about a good mile from home and at the top of a hill next to which is my house in the expansive valley below it, I could see helicopters everywhere. Even If I couldn&apos;t see bright lights like I could from some of them, there was always one around. I would look into the sky and see a flash of some helicopter or something very far off, an impossible distance to identify what, but it was the artificial flash of a helicopter. They were everywhere. Cops too were hurriedly congregating, I saw three suddenly rush into a meeting place and I was walking across the street from the storage facility they met at. They got out of their cars and talked about &quot;I saw blah&quot; &quot;It was seen&quot; &quot;blah blah seen.&quot; I  couldn&apos;t really make out what they were saying, but they were all sharing about something they saw. It may have been in relation to a criminal act, but events were weird as is. (What&apos;s weird is that the UFO remi! nded me of a dream I had a while back about UFOs. I almost never have dreams about them and I know that it wasn&apos;t a real abduction, just my unconscious playing around, but it still looked similar to my abduction dream.) Oh yeah, plus there were a ton of other aircraft around, but this glided by pretty quickly and in it&apos;s own direction, not one that is a flight path. It was foggy and hazy tonight everywhere, but this was mostly below the clouds.",

As i walked into parking lot of my apartment building, I looked into the sky as I do every night.  I noticed a bright light in the sky moving due east.  I watched this bright light for about 5 minutes as it moved over the Bridger mountains between Bozeman and Livingston Montana.  While I was watching it, I was comparing it to a plane in the sky flying NW.  The plane was flying faster and at a higher altitude than the light.  The light was flying very slowly and did not have any of the standard marking lights that airliners have. (ie. red and blue wing lights and the blinking belly light)  After about five minutes or so it then faded out. I didn&apos;t see it for the rest of the walk.  When I came back inside I checked Nasa&apos;s site to see where the ISS was in comparison to my location.  It was between South America and Africa at the time.  I should also mention that the light was flying at a higher altit! ude than a Japanese flying lantern can get and the light was flying slower than a meteor.

After about two minutes silence she slowly muttered a statement such as, &ldquo;Oh wow&rdquo; and expressed she saw the blinking lights of alien spaceships in the sky! I was on a busy highway so I didn&rsquo;t glance her way.Of course my reaction was disbelief and we spoke of stars and such for the remainder of our 5-10 minutes drive home.East of our home lies an extinct volcano with a prominent observatory and to the west, the ocean, while we live in a small urban area. The sky was crystal clear, a typically pristine and cloudless Hawaiian evening, yet, when she and I hopped out of the car (it is a large outdoor parking lot), I spotted in the sky, a lone, transparent cloud hovering about 30 feet above us. As far as I can tell, no one else is around. I see around 30-50 lights moving and blinking and &ldquo;dancing&rdquo; very quickly inside of the cloud. Both of us rub our eyes wondering if our vision is messed up. The cloud is maybe the size of a small, one story home and doesn&rsquo;t move but the lights are bouncy and wild, like we were watching a light show, but nothing I could imagine projected the lights, onto the solo cloud, from below; it was absolutely illogical. I viewed it for maybe 2 or 3 minutes and it &ldquo;felt&rdquo; &ldquo;celebratory&rdquo;.My daughter studied the phenomena in the car for 10 minutes, and described it as 4 round spaceships that initially rotated super fast, clockwise and then, counterclockwise. One of the discs stood apart, however and didn&rsquo;t move like the others. The 3 disc&rsquo;s movement altered from circular to a more randomness, when we were in the parking lot. She also explained the cloud with ships, didn&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;top&rdquo; (lid) to it. I&rsquo;m not certain if she meant the cloud or the ships or both. As I was looking at it, my feeling wasn&rsquo;t of fear at all.My 2 yr-old needed to be retrieved from the car so I decided to attend to her and then watch the strange cloud after I gathered up my baby, but in a manner of about a minute the entire thing had vanished. My six year-old had been looking away, too, so missed its disappearance. I told her it was an &ldquo;angel&rdquo; so she wouldn&rsquo;t be afraid, and every trace of lights and ghost-like cloud substance, dematerialized within under a minute.",

The meteorite made the local news but I have not seen any reports of the craft that emerged from it.

We were eastbound on Hwy 98 in Destin, Fl. Having just left the restaurant which is at 21000 Emerald coast highway.  After driving about a half mile east, I happened to notice a series of lights to the north of the highway, hanging in the sky.  They were quite bright and stationary, so I thought they were probably some outdoor stadium lights.  They literally lit up the bottoms of some low clouds that were passing above them.  That&rsquo;s when I realized they weren&rsquo;t stadium lights, since they wouldn&rsquo;t have projected upwards.  My wife also saw them and thought they were lights on top of a hill, then realized that there are no hills around here and wondered what they were. When I saw them, there were three lights, when she saw them, there were two , but then.another showed up to form a triangular light pattern, then two more showed up below and to the west of the first group.  We continued to drive east and talked about them.  At first I thought they were helicopters with their front lights on,  but as we drove along, they got neither closer nor farther away and also seemed suspended in one spot relative to one another.  Also, there was no familiar sound such as 5 helicopters would have made.  Here in Destin, helicopters are flying around all the time and there is no such thing as a silent flight of them. We continued to drive east, discussing what they might or might not be&hellip;&hellip;all the time they were just hanging in the sky.  Finally we came to an intersection about two miles away at Matthew Road where I could pull off, which I did and turned into the parking lot of a service station.  I grabbed our FLIP camera, rolled down the window and started filming them.  Shortly after that, the lights began dimming, one by one, till they were gone from the sky as shown on the video. Some observations that are not apparent from the video:  The lights were VERY bright, lighting up the bottom of the clouds more than is apparent in the video  They were absolutely stationary relative to our position, even though we drove over two miles on the ground as we observed them.

20100315,20100315," Southbridge, MA", triangle,6-7 minutes,"Wedge shaped, Unusual lights, severe ozone smellOn January 22, 2010 I went outside around 1030 to walk my dog. I live in a single-family home on approximately 3 acres. The night was clear and cold. I looked up to the stars as I usually do, as we walked in the backyard. Something caught my eye for a moment to the east in the sky. It appeared to be a low flying craft, with a bright light, what I assumed were landing headlights. I see them all the time because my home is situated under a normal flight path for Logan, and there is a municipal small craft airport about a mile from my home so it&rsquo;s not unusual to see several aircraft in the sky along with the nightly stars, so I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention. At that time the &ldquo;light&rdquo; was approximately 15-20 miles away. As my dog was finishing up her &ldquo;business&rdquo; I looked back at the light because I thought the angle of the light was odd. A direction I hadn&rsquo;t seen before so I stopped and gazed up, facing directly east now the light was of a pattern and configuration I! had never seen before, and I watched and waited for it to come closer, as I am in the habit of doing, I like watching the different jets pass overhead again I spend a lot of time outdoors here especially at night, I have a nice telescope that I enjoy using an outdoor fireplace, so the backyards a lot of fun. Anyway as the &ldquo;what I think&rdquo; is a jet gets closer, I start to see odd lights Like on the &ldquo;belly&rdquo; The first thing that came to mind was that it must be some promo like you see at the beach, when planes drag those banners in the sky except this must be something knew, because its like so bright and so BIG and there is 2 white lights and this big red sort of like times square blinking symbol. Of what I have no idea. At this point I notice 3 odd things. One the ozone smell is stronger than I&apos;ve ever smelled, the air seems to be electrified somehow and this thing passing directly over me now is NOT A PLANE, it&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve never seen before, wedge shaped, triangular, si! lent, slow, and HUGE, 2-3 footballs fields huge. I watched it ! pass ove r me, incredulous to what I was seeing, not believing, The craft moved from direct to east to direct west. After it disappeared in the night&rsquo;s horizon, I went back in the house, sat down and decided I wouldn&rsquo;t tell anyone, because I don&rsquo;t want people to think I&rsquo;m a nut. BUT. Its kind of been bugging me. I think about every day and replay it in my mind several times. I don&rsquo;t want to keep silent. I saw this thing. I&rsquo;m not saying its extraterrestrial. But it is something that I have never seen or felt before. And it was so obvious, so UNSTEALTH like, just there. HUGE.  Unfortunately I&rsquo;m unemployed right now, and my cell phone is &ldquo;off&rdquo; so I have no pictures or video,((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

As I looked up in that direction I saw at least 8 spheres of orange lights.  One man was attempting to film this with his digital camera (which was unsuccessful).  He was looking through the zoom lens and said they looked really big in relation the foreground.  The men present also said there had been at least 15 lights earlier but  some had already dimmed.As we watched, we saw a small plane heading south to the Ogden Airport.  The lights appeared to move up and spread out more.  They all moved in a horizontal independent motion with no sound.  One of the men who was there first stated he saw them &quot;pour out&quot; of a spot in the sky 10-12 minutes earlier.As I studied the balls of light I could see that the orange glow was of nothing like I have ever seen.  It seemed to have an organic quality with a rich color and no pulsing.All of us felt we were being watched.Then to our amazement the lights snapped into geometric star formations.  Most of them drew into the Orion constellation.The remainder of the spheres spread out over our heads.  When they moved in this way, we all felt uneasy, as it was such an intelligent action.At that point all of them started to fade their color and with the naked eye you could see a dim metallic surface on the spheres like the way the dark side of the moon glows.  Within two minutes they kept fading out to be barely visible and then it was stars in their place.Note:  There are another group of witnesses who reported this occurrence which was posted that evening.",

I had actually just had a conversation a few hours prior with our hosts about UFO sightings and prevalence in the area. That night, my girlfriend and I were sitting on their deck enjoying a romantic evening when 5-6 lights appeared maybe 35 degrees above the horizon.  At first I dismissed it thinking that it was just a group of air planes from the nearby military base, but as we watch the lights go higher in the sky they began to divide into smaller points of light and dramatically change direction.  By now we were curious, knowing that neither of us had seen anything move so quickly and precisely in the sky before.  The lights came closer and closer and were just below cloud level when all of the darting points reconvened and assumed a linear shape.  The lights were at an angle that made it impossible to tell for sure, but it looked almost like a bent line (chevron?) as it veered north.What made it so peculiar and distinctively not an airplane was the in consistency of its movement and the way the lights divided themselves.  I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it and must say that it was certainly one of the most eye opening experiences I&rsquo;ve ever had.((NUFORC Note:  Date is not indicated by the source of the report.

I saw two things:  the first was clearly a jet airplane, very small and moving near the horizon in a southernly direction,  but with the blinking lights there was no question it was a jet.  I then saw what I first thought was a &quot;shooting star&quot; to the west of the jet, but it was moving in a north westerly direction--kind of at a 45 degree angle--moving UP, not down.  But it did not dissipate like a shooting star, it just kept moving upwards at a 45 degree angle at a high rate of speed for somthing that small.   It looked just like a twinkling star--similar to those in the sky around it--not like the far off jet I had already seen.   It continued to move up in the western sky, then slowed and stopped.  It looked just like the other twinkling stars in the sky.   Then it just stayed t! here, fixed.  I thought it must be another jet that had ascended then turned either away from me, or towards me, and would either grow larger or disappear, as planes at night do.  But it did neither.

Witness stated that as they drove southbound (actually SE toward Atlanta) he observed a steady circular glowing light moving E to W (left to right) about 45 degrees above the horizon. The course seemed to be more or less straight and horizontal, but as it approached the extreme right of his field of view (about 2/3s of the way through the duration) it seemed to gradually arc slightly downward.THE DURATION OF THE OBSERVATION WAS ABOUT 4&frac12; TO 5 MINUTES, THE LIGHT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE MOVING AT THE SPEED OF THE MANY REPORTED FIREBALL METEORS.The traffic began to slow down and backup as they watched, as if other drivers were also observing this event. Witness thought that he lost sight either by it going into the distance or perhaps some obstruction eventually blocking the view. During further discussion, witness stated that he did not notice any burning-like effect, no glowing debris breaking away, no smoke or luminescent trail or terminal burst. It just appeared circular, steady, glowing bright blue-green, no fuselage-like structure observed. No electromagnetic or physical effects were noticed. Also observed was a large aircraft, perhaps large airliner size, moving rather fast in the distance, but unknown if related to the original observation. Witness stated the light&apos;s size was about that of three (3) lunar masses, but he could not specifically equate to the lunar diameters or mass. He estimated about the size of a quarter held out at arms length which is about three lunar diameters = about 1 1/2 degrees.GPS Coordinates for I-75SB @ I-575 Interchange: 33&deg;59&apos;53N and 84&deg;33&apos;39W.A check of the data base at the &apos;Center for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies&apos; revealed no scheduled man-made reentries for the time period of the event described herein. As well, a check of the database of the &apos;American Meteor Society&apos; found no recorded observations of any fireball activity in the SE United States for the same period.The witness agreed to continue his assistance and provide more data as this inquiry unfolds.This investigator has requested identification data and a statement from the two secondary witnesses, but this has not been received as of 24Nov09.Additional research in this matter has included checking for NASA launches involving various atmospheric experiments as in the &apos;barium cloud&apos; launches that generated several reports in past years. Information from the official NASA website indicated that on 19Sept09 (five days prior to this event reported to CMS) NASA launched the below described experiment. As indicated in the NASA mission profile below........&quot;STPSAT-1 will track the &apos;CARE&apos; dust cloud for DAYS or even MONTHS.......first space viewing of an artificial noctilucent cloud.......visible ONLY when illuminated by sunlight from below the horizon while the earth&apos;s surface is in darkness......&quot;  --------------------------------------------------------  Description of mission from the NASA web site, Wallops Flight Facility;  &quot;Night Time Artificial Cloud Study Using NASA Sounding Rocket09.19.09 A NASA Black Brant XII rocket launches carrying the CARE experiment Credit: NASA View Larger Image A rocket experiment that may shed light on the highest clouds in the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere was conducted from NASA&apos;s Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia on September 19, 2009. The experiment was launched on a NASA Black Brant XII Sounding Rocket.The Charged Aerosol Release Experiment (CARE) was conducted by the Naval Research Laboratory and the Department of Defense Space Test Program using a NASA four-stage Black Brant XII suborbital sounding rocket. Using ground based instruments and the STP/NRL STPSat-1 spacecraft, scientists will study an artificial noctilucent cloud formed by the exhaust particles of the rocket&rsquo;s fourth stage at about 173 miles altitude.Ground based cameras and radars were based at various observation stations along the Atlantic coast and in Bermuda. Because of the optical observations, the launch required clear skies not only at Wallops but also at the multiple observation stations.The Spatial Heterodyne IMager for MEsospheric Radicals instrument on the STPSat-1 spacecraft will track the CARE dust cloud for days or even months. The SHIMMER instrument has previously viewed natural noctilucent clouds for the past two years. The CARE is the first space viewing of an artificial noctilucent cloud.Data collected during the experiment will provide insight into the formation, evolution, and properties of noctilucent clouds, which are typically observed naturally at high latitudes. In addition to the understanding of noctilucent clouds, scientists will use the experiment to validate and develop simulation models that predict the distribution of dust particles from rocket motors in the upper atmosphere.Natural noctilucent clouds, also known as polar mesospheric clouds, are found in the upper atmosphere as spectacular displays that are most easily seen just after sunset. The clouds are the highest clouds in Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere, located in the mesosphere around 50 miles altitude.They are normally too faint to be seen with the naked eye and are visible only when illuminated by sunlight from below the horizon while the Earth&rsquo;s surface is in darkness.A team from government agencies and universities, led by the Naval Research Laboratory, is conducting the experiment. In addition to the Naval Research Laboratory, participants include the DoD STP, NASA, University of Michigan, Air Force Research Laboratory, Clemson University, Stanford University, University of Colorado, Penn State University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Haystack Observatory&quot;.End NASA mission description.9Dec09, this investigator spoke with Dr. Paul A. Bernhardt of the Navy Research Laboratory, Plasma Physics Division, Washington D.C., 202-767-0196, bern@ppd.nrl.navy.mil  Dr. Bernhardt was the chief scientist and supervisor for the NASA &apos;CARE&apos; rocket launch from Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia on 19Sept09.This event was described to him, and he was asked if the resulting experimental noctilucent cloud could have drifted near or over Georgia in the days after the launch and experiment. He responded that things at that 100+ kilometer altitude (ionosphere) were very different and winds below would not influence the cloud. However he stated that it is feasible that the cloud, or a part thereof, might have drifted over Georgia or vicinity, but would definitely need to be illuminated by sunlight (as stated in the mission abstract) to be visible to the human eye. When asked, he replied that the color of the cloud at the time of the experiment, immediately following the launch, was blue. During additional comments, he stated that another type of experiment connected to research at Clemson involved a release of TMA or trimethyl aluminum. TMA chemically reacts with oxygen thereby creating a bluish effect or cloud that is self-luminous.A check of the various science departments at Clemson indicated that the TMA launchs were from several years ago and no recent activity was noted.The witness in this case stated that their observation occurred about mid-night on 24Sept09. This FI is of the opinion that the sun, being almost directly on the opposite side of the earth, would not provide any light in the ionosphere over or near Georgia to illuminate a cloud such as that created in the &apos;CARE&apos; experiment. Orbital satellites are not visible after about 10-11PM and until about 5-6AM, thus the lower altitude of any said cloud would likewise be in the earth&apos;s shadow.General information-only descriptions of this event/time/date were forwarded to Peter Davenport at NUFORC and the independent TUFORC (Truckers UFO Reporting Center)in an effort to locate any potential motorists/witnesses in the event vicinity on 24Sept09.Potential witnesses reading this request at NUFORC and TUFORC will hopefully contact MUFON of Georgia.From the NUFORC data base:  Occurred : 9/24/2009 00:00 (Entered as : 09242009 0:00) Reported: 11/24/2009 11:02:55 PM 23:02 Posted: 12/12/2009 Location: Marietta/Kennesaw, GA Shape: Other Duration:5 minutes MUFON of Georgia is, as of 24Nov09, investigating CMS report #20271 which occurred on 24Sept09 at about 12:00 midnight.Location of witnesses: I-75 southbound at its intersection with I-575 in Cobb County Georgia (which is just a few miles north of Kennesaw and Marietta Georgia). This Interstate intersection is also about 20 miles NW of Atlanta.A dramatic observation took place at this time and date from the described location. MUFON of Georgia is seeking additional witnesses.If you observed any unusual aerial activity on that occasion, please contact Tom Sheets, State Director-MUFON of Georgia at ; After 1Jan10, contact Ralph Howard .Please note that like NUFORC, MUFON will keep all witnesses anonymous.NOTE: MUFONGA will post a full and complete report here at NUFORC as soon as this MUFON investigation is completed.Tom Sheets, SD MUFONGA  --------------------------------------------------------  During the week of Christmas, this writer was back in touch with the witness to remind of the importance of interviewing the two co-witnesses (family members) and obtaining the sketch of how the event appeared through the vehicle windshield.In a 23Dec response, the witness advised that things had not been going well, citing a family death, a serious illness, as well as his aformentioned extreme financial distress. He did state he would arrange all of this as things were resolved. Nothing more has been forthcoming as of 22Jan10. As cited in the below email to the PAO of the nearby Dobbins Air Reserve Base, the PAO had failed to respond to the email request, as well as several phone messages left for him during November and December. One message was also left in the Operations Center of the 94th Airlift Squadron, the major unit utilizing this base. In mid-January, this writer emailed the PAO again explaining all that was needed was some information regarding the night of the event.....anything that the squadron may have been doing that might have been observed by the witness and mistaken for an aerial phenomenon. Furthermore that if this could be done by a simple phone call, it would prevent the red-tape of my filing under the FOIA. On 19Jan10, this writer received a phone call from a XXX XXXXXXXX who stated he was the PAO. He was immediately rude in tone, condescending in nature and openly hostile to the purpose of MUFON. He stated that the reason I had not heard anything from them was that they ign! ored anything to do with &apos;UFOs&apos;, &apos;space&apos; and such things. Furthermore, when such things came in they just put them aside and went on to something else or words to that effect. This writer then gave him a short &apos;MUFON 101&apos; explanation, concluding that there were members within our organization that militarily far out ranked him and his associates and that our goals and objectives were based in science and so forth. Before concluding, he indicated that nothing had occurred that would have caused such aerial activity as observed by the witness, but his statement was couched in terms that clearly indicated he would NOT have told us even if something HAD occurred that could be mistaken for an aerial phenomenon. This PAO was directly opposite in attitude when compared to the last such request from this investigator which went through LtCol. XXXXXXXXX of the Georgia Air National Guard......... LtCol. XXXXXXXXX being a true gentleman and professional, and very helpful. At this point, 22Jan10, the aerial event described herein exists only through the claims of the primary witness. The data in this report was discussed with him in several long phone conversations and emails. He appeared rational and cooperative throughout and had initially told this writer that his situation at home was degenerating as the holidays approached and was due to the economy, his frustrating search for a better job and various health matters within the family. At such point in an investigation, this writer has an expectation of having successfully interviewed corroborating witnesses and receiving a witness sketch.This has not been accomplished due to the reasons explained. In classifying this case, the probable cause used to do so is WEAK in this investigators opinion, but the witness will be given the benefit of a doubt in anticipation of him providing the needed information as his situation improves i.e. the case being re-opened at that time in hopes that the corroborating witnesses will have come forward. This case is classified as Unknown-Other, but subject to being re-opened when the additional data is received.

Sheets of Fayetteville Georgia here, State Director for MUFON of Georgia (Georgia Division of the Mutual UFO Network....the largest and oldest international scientific group researching aerial phenomenon). We are currently looking into an event that occurred on 24Sept09 at about 12:00 Midnight. This occurrence was observed by multiple witnesses that were traveling southbound on I-75 at it&apos;s juncture with I-575 in Cobb County, putting their position a few (+) miles north of the base at appx. 33&deg;59&apos;53N and 84&deg;33&apos;39W, looking generally SSE or SE. A brilliant blue-green round light appearing to be the mass of 3 lunar diameters was observed moving from E to W about 45&deg; above the horizon. This light did not move at the speed of the commonly observed fireball meteors, bolide meteors, or even returning space debris. It was under observation for about 5 minutes (a long time as these things go) as the vehicles drove south on I-75. The light seeming to move E to W (left to right) at a more or less horizontal angle (perhaps the reported movement of the light may have been an illusion due to the forward motion of the Interstate traffic). The traffic began to slow down and back up due to the dramatic nature of this observation. We are currently scrutinizing the experimental artificial noctilucent cloud that was created by NASA on 19Sept09 after the Black Brant XII launch from Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. NASA has advised that this cloud may be visible after dark for weeks or months when the sun is illuminating it due to! the extremely high altitude. It is possible that this extremely high altitude cloud could have drifted over Georgia in the days after the launch and thus was illuminated after dark by the sun hitting it from the daylight side of the earth. That is one possibility we must check. Anyhow, I wanted to ask if you could advise us if the 94th Squadron, Lockheed, or any other entity from the base might have been conducting training, flight operations, or tests of any sort that might have been responsible for what was observed. If so, we don&apos;t necessarily need to know the exact type of operation if it might be classified or confidential and so forth. We&apos;re just in the process of our elimination procedure common to all of our investigations. About 95+% of everything reported to us is eventually proved to be prosaic, mundane everyday occurrences, natural or misunderstood man-made etc. However, the remaining 5 or so percent does often get classified as unknown. As well, did your office receive any calls from the public on or about 24-25Sept09 regarding observation this event?  Any help you can provide will be much appreciated.

The formation crossed the entire night sky and I lost sight of it as it headed further west/northwest coming from the east, almost directly overhead... about 70-80 degrees.The shapes came together or it could have been the angle, but they disappeared as they &apos;converged&apos; still at approx 80 degrees.The night sky was surprisingly clear and I immediately posted a question on yahoo answers dated 03/16/2010.  I do observe meteor showers and comets when in season, but this looked nothing like anything i had observed in the past...  the objects seemed to be flying extremely fast for any man made vehicle, but steadier (did not fade out) than shooting stars i&apos;ve seen in the past.The color was clearly orange amberish.I&apos;m no &apos;third kind encounter&apos; type of individual and I felt that anyone i told would think i&apos;m crazy... i&apos;m very much sane and i am a systems engineer so I&apos;m very empirical and quantitative.

I was looking out my two rear bedroom windows into the dark when I noticed some very odd lights out in the woods above a house on the other side of our neighborhood pond.  It was very dark but you could still see the dark outlines of the pine trees in the woods and the lights from the neighboring houses.  The flying lights reminded me of a police car&rsquo;s lights and I thought I was catching a reflection in the window glass from the room behind me.  My son&rsquo;s bedroom was directly behind me and a police officer lives up a road right in front of my house.  The mail box the police officer uses is also right across the road from my house.  The lights were almost standing still and then moved very slowly to the left.  I wondered what the police car was up to so I turned around to see out windows in the front of the house.  That&rsquo;s when I was shocked by the fact that my bedroom do! or was closed and that what I was looking at was not a reflection.  I stood up and put my face and hands to the glass to block all reflections from other lights in my room and I saw clearly a large set of lights in a very strange configuration moving very slowly to the left over my neighbors house. There were three colors of lights.   The largest lights were a pair of rectangular almost square lights.  The light on the right was bright blue and the light connected to it on the left was bright white.  Both of these lights were very bright and the shape was very clear.  Two small red lights were above these lights, one on the left and one on the right.  One small red light was in the center on the bottom.  The whole thing looked like a mixed up set of tail lights on the rear end of a car.  I was talking to my father the whole time and he said that I was starting to worry him.  I described what I saw to him and he said go outside to see if I could hear anything.  I went out my! back door onto my porch and stood on my picnic table.  I coul! d still see the objects lights very clearly.  The set of lights moved slowly, there was absolutely no noise.  I continued to talk to my father and I was getting very excited.  I knew that what I was seeing had to be something very odd maybe a UFO.  I was convinced of this by the slow speed, the distinct shape of lights, the brightness of the lights, and the dead silence.  The lights then moved on to the left behind a larger set of pine trees.  When I moved my head back and forth I could still catch glimpses of it.  The lights then started to come back to the right and then the moved back to the left even further until I could not see it at all.  While I was standing on my picnic table talking to my father after the lights vanished, I saw the small white lights of an airplane way up in the sky.

They were nearly directly above the flight path for jets landing at Sky Harbor Airport, and appeared to be at an elevation that aircraft would need to be pressurized or at least would leave a vapor trail.  Although they seemed directly above the flight pattern for landing, I expect they were slightly north/northeast.My sense were that these objects could have been parachutes as they may seemed rectangular in shape, and since they didn&apos;t appear to be moving laterally, that&apos;s all I could think of.  While watching them for about 15 seconds, a third object appeared to the east of them but was a bright blue and of the same shape.  This third object reinforced my reasoning for thinking they were parachutes, because I could imagine that being a parachute color.  The only thing that baffled me about the parachute theory was who would attempt, or get permission to parachute in this area with such heavy airline traffic.About 10 seconds after I first noticed the blue object, it disappeared.  I didn&rsquo;t see it move or actually disappear, as I was talking to a passerby about it, but when I looked back up it was gone.The remaining two objects maintained their altitude, and moved to the west at what seemed to be a relatively slow speed.

I figured it was a weather balloon, but decided to watch it anyway. The sphere, or circle was white and had a glow. It moved slowly for another minute and then...stopped. The sphere remained stopped for about 15 minutes in the same spot, so I had plenty of time to get photos with my digital camera(I realized it could not be a balloon since the wind would have moved it along).The object also appeared to change shape or wobble. The object was a few miles away so the shots were taken by using the zoom on my camera. There was no sound and the sphere appeared to be about 8,000 feet up. The object then changed direction and moved slowly going south and out of distance. I have two pictures. One is of the glowing sphere/circle and the o! ther shot I did not see with the naked eye.  But my digital camera picked it up.  I think as the object was changing shape, my camera caught some type of morphing or energy field in between the diffferent shapes?

It was moving in smooth fluid motions, not in a jerky manner. The flash from this object was very bright and constant.  We were watching this object for a couple of minutes as it was moving about the sky.  All of a sudden, we noticed another bright light in the sky fairly close to the first one sighted.  The second object seemed to be moving in a circular or looping motion.  The four of us continued watching these objects for another minute or so until both objects were either to far to see them any longer or they disappeared/vanished.  We did not see the second object moving towards the first object at all during this incident, it seemed ! to just appear close to it. When I returned home later in the day I tried to duplicate the brightness of the steady &quot;flash&quot; from the objects, I put a piece of aluminum foil under my overhead kitchen light with the shiny side towards the light bulb to reflect the light.

Instantly I heard dogs barking and howling in the Northwest direction of the neighborhood. Right away I looked up in the sky and I always do when I go outside, and to my left I saw a low-flying SILENT vehicle that was heading Southeast to Northwest direction.  It was close enough (about 100 yards up) that I saw the bottom of the triangle shaped vehicle.  I was thinking it would hit some trees or crash because it was so low.  I could see the bottom of the jet sized vehicle, but it was triangle shaped and didn&apos;t look like a plane or jet.  There were bright orange lights on the bottom.  I watched it zoom by at about 100 miles an hour - it looked like a fast moving car speed.  I could only watch the vehicle between the trees, probably for about 5 seconds.  We ran to see if we could see anything on the other side of the trees but it was no where in sig! ht.  The dogs kept barking when the vehicle passed over where the barking noises came from. After the vehicle had passed I stayed outside looking in the sky for other signs and I saw a lighter gray trail in the sky.

I always keep my porch light off and my kitchen light off with only my dining light on.  I also close the door almost shut to keep the smoke out of my house and so I can see the stars better.  I often look into the sky at the stars which are very visible.  I noticed a very large and bright white light coming in my direction.  I noticed it zigzagging back and forth in quick changes in direction.  I thought that maybe clouds may be causing the illusion of the zigzagging.  As I watched it, I rolled my eyes off it on each side to make certain there were no clouds, there were none (was taught this by the military).  All of the sudden the object moved upward out of sight very quickly.  I could see the light go from very large to a tiny light to nothing at all but with a light trail behind it upward.  Just to make this clear, I served in the Marine Corp and worked with UH-1 and Cobra helicopters both at night and during the day.  I&rsquo;ve been around the flight line both night and day with both rotary and fixed wings.  I did not see a starboard or port light on this object, nor did I hear any noise coming from it.   As close as this object was from me, if this were a fixed wing aircraft I would have surely heard the thrusters especially as quick as it went upward out of sight.  If it were a helicopter, I would have heard the chopping of the blades and there is no doubt in my mind that a helicopter could not have climbed that quickly upward to out of sight in two or three seconds.  The object was coming from the west with probably 15 degrees of it to the north.   Almost as soon as the object excelled out of sight, a plane (jet) of some type flew over my location coming from the south west.  I could hear and see the port and starboard lights on it.

First began at approx. 23:00 with a large, fast moving, blue lighten (6 blue lights), curved, arch like formation over some trees in the distance. 2 witnesses saw this event, the third missed it by a fraction of a second.  About 15 minutes later, a similar craft with 4 lights was seen moving much faster in a different direction across the sky, except this time it was a light grayish-brown shade.  Moments later, in the opposite side of the sky, 5 very distinct, very bright lights slowly glided across the sky.  These lights had a symmetrical formation and moved in and out like a flowing organism.  All three witnesses were taken by the sight, and amazed at the possibility of three sightings in a matter of minutes.  Then, about 10 minutes later, out of the center of the sky appeared two, candle like lights floating symmetrically across the sky, to the edge of the horizon.  Flowing i! n and out in perfect motion. And again these two appeared in the same way another 5 minutes later.  Next, after about 15 minutes of waiting, a single glowing object appeared on the far side of the horizon and floated behind the home, out of sight to the witnesses.  Then, to conclude the experience, 5 very prominent, bright candle like objects, floated very slowly, very low over the home.  They drifted further and closer to each other and seem to have a distinct pattern to them.  They drifted slowly across the sky, and went out of sight approximately 45 seconds after they appeared. the last event was significantly longer than any other sighting of the night.

20100319,20100319," Eureka, CA", light,5-10 minutes,"Large, bright light moving over Samoa Beach, then disappearing...My wife and I had gone to the beach, as it was an unusually warm evening for mid-March. The sky was absolutely clear, with a sliver of a Moon that looked like a big smile, and tons of visible stars. I had spotted a satellite moving directly overhead moving from south to north, and we watched it until we couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore. Just then, my wife says, &ldquo;Look , there&rsquo;s another one!&rdquo;, and points due west. I turned to look, and I saw a  very, very bright white light moving from the west toward the east. The light had a blue tint to it, kind of like an LED light bulb is, as opposed to an incandescent bulb which is much more yellow.When I first turned and saw the light, it was at around 45 to 50 degrees, moving fairly quickly west to east in a straight line, it&rsquo;s path just south of us. If I held an aspirin tablet between my fingers at arm&rsquo;s length, that would be slightly larger, but reasonably comparable to the size of the light. It was by far the brightest thing in the sky.  As the light moved to about 85 degrees, almost directly overhead, it never deviated in intensity, flashed, or seemed directional in any way, like the headlight of a low flying airplane would. It then began to move in a wide arc toward the southeast. As it did, it began to slowly dim, until it was the size and intensity of  any random star in the sky. In fact, it now actually did look like a satellite, except for the fact that it was turning toward the southeast. We watched it for another few seconds, and then it just winked out.My wife and I were discussing what we had just seen, still facing the direction we had last seen it. I was excited, as I have witnessed the same type of light on two other occasions from my backyard (which, incidentally, faces due west), but I was always alone without any other witnesses.  As we were talking, there was a sudden bright flash of light, similar to a camera flash, at about 45 degrees, just a bit east of where we saw the light blink out, maybe 15 - 20 seconds before. We both looked up and saw what appeared to be 2 satellite sized lights moving  SE to NW in a path that would go directly over our heads. They were moving parallel to each other, although one was moving slower. As we watched, the slower one started to &ldquo;pulse&rdquo;. It was going from looking like a satellite, to slowly dimming until it was completely dark, and then slowly brightening back to looking like a satellite again. I then realized that the faster of the two actually was a satellite, as it continued ! across the sky in a straight line at the same speed. The &ldquo;pulsing&rdquo; light now started moving in a more northerly direction rather than northwesterly as it had been. It began moving slower and slower until it eventually stopped, hanging at about 55 -60 degrees in the eastern sky, doing it&rsquo;s pulsating thing. As I turned back toward the northwest to see if the other satellite (which by now had passed by us) was still acting like a satellite (which it was), we noticed a small plane flying directly toward us at around 700 ft headed toward a small landing strip a mile or so down the road. I immediately looked back to the &ldquo;pulsing&rdquo; light. It grew dim and bright a few more times, then it stayed steadily bright, and looked like an ordinary star.The plane served as a comparison to the original light we saw come from the west. First, the plane&rsquo;s headlight was very yellow in color and much dimmer. It also had obvious green and red flashing lights, and it was loud; very easily heard over the breaking of the waves, whereas the mystery light was completely silent. Also, the plane&rsquo;s presence gave me a sense of how high the light was. I guesstimated the plane to be at about 500 - 700 ft and descending, which made me feel like the first time we saw the light, it was about twice that height. The second time, it looked as high as the other satellite, even though it was only 15 - 20 seconds later. My wife told me that when she first saw the light and said, &ldquo;Look, there&rsquo;s another one&rdquo;, it was the size of a satellite, and in a fraction of a second, it was super bright and huge, which is right when I saw it the first time.After the plane flew by, the light, which was now stationary, and looked like an ordinary star, faded out and we didn&rsquo;t see it again. I also wanted to say that during the first part of the sighting, my wife had a feeling of dread, and had started to cry. She kept saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo; over and over. I, on the other hand, was excited, and was extremely happy to have a witness with me.",

For the past three months, I have watched the same UFO moving in the night sky over the Pine Barrens.  Every night without fail, it moves. It is also the brightest light in the sky, which also emits a faint pulse.  I believe it is masking itself as a star by maintaining a stationary position outside our gravity well giving the appearance of a star progressing across the night sky.Every night I watch it move in short erratic patterns, vertical, horizontal and circular, which I believe is to maintain its fixed position.

20100320,20100320," Brentwood, NY", disk,3-5 minutes,"I might be a match for a report in your databaseWhen I was a young child I witnessed a UFO outside my bathroom window.  My whole life I was certain of what happened and was surprised I never heard anything more about it.  In my adult life I have heard people on TV and in articles describe what they have seen and I have never heard anyone describe one like I saw.  Then I just came across your site and database, and went through all the months and years of my childhood hoping to find something that has troubled me my whole life.  All of the sudden &quot;Disco&quot; I came across that blew my mind and is about exactly the right time of when I was a child that I may have seen this.  The thing that blew me away was his description of the ship...when he described it the hair on the back of my neck stood up.  It was the case reported on 6/15/76 in Smithtown New York.  I am almost certain we saw the same thing.  Is there a way for me to get in touch with this person and ask him more questions?  I mean to be alone with this! my whole life and find this is no way a coincidence.  What I really want to do is see if we can compare sketches of what we saw.  Please help me this is so important to me.I need to tell you what happen to me as a child though because I probably have thought about it every day of my life.  It was somewhere between 9-11 pm...I don&apos;t know exactly what I was doing prior to going into the bathroom, but I went into the bathroom and was standing in front of the toilet.  Immediately to the right of the toilet is a window that you can freely look out.  I glanced out the window and was immediately captivated by what I saw.  Above the tree line was this craft hovering above the trees.  Around the bottom of the saucer was lights flashing in a sequence all around the bottom of it, lights going in circles.  These light panels so to speak were also windows.  In the center on the top was a cap that may have been clear.  I knew the second I saw it exactly what it was, which was a UFO.  I also knew deep down inside something was aware that I was watching it.  It wasn&apos;t a scary feeling of any type, but I knew someone was aware of me.  It mostly hovered the whol! e time in the same place.  I knew what I was looking at and was so excited that I ran into the living room and was screaming for my parents to come and look at this.  We ran back to the window for me to show him and I pointed out the window.  He was starring out the window going, &quot;where, where??&quot;  Here is the total bizarre thing...the UFO was sitting there as clear as can be and I am starring at this thing pointing and screaming at it and he just could not see it at all.  I also was then set in with a feeling that for whatever reason, it isn&apos;t possible for him to see what I can see.  As this was going on, I can still feel this really weird awareness.  This sense that they are aware of me, and I am aware of them, and at this time I am only able to see it.  I don&apos;t know how that is possible but as a child this was all crystal clear to me.  I also was aware that they were now leaving and I watched it slowly move away from me as it is leaving, again I had this awareness inside ! they were leaving and still can feel them watching me as they ! moved aw ay, and then there was just this sudden zip away from me and it disappeared.I am going to try and explain one other thing that is probably going to sound absolutely nuts!  Truth is, from the time I saw the craft out the window, to the time I ran out for my parents, I really have no idea how long that time is.  It feels like it is only a moment, but something deep down inside me feels like it was actually a lot longer, but &quot;made&quot; to feel like a moment or two.  I feel like I just completely lost a sense for solid time during this period.  Even after the whole thing was over, I still had this feeling of &quot;lost time.&quot;  My memories feel fluid, but even today there is this feeling of lost time somewhere in there like something happen to me but I really have no idea what.There is something else that is very odd and probably completely off the wall.  I have no idea why I associate what I am going to say with the sighting but I have always wonder this my adult life.  I have also never told another soul this in the world because I would think somebody is completely nuts if they told me this.  Around the time of all this in my life I have noticed a little bump under my skin on my shin that&apos;s like a small pellet.  I didn&apos;t have any type of accident, there is no scar, no childhood accident that would of cause this but my whole adult life I have always felt that something was put there by them somehow.  I have no memory of anything like this at all happening surrounding the craft, but something sick in my stomach tells me otherwise.  One of these days I am going to get that thing cut out and find out exactly what it is.Anyway...the report you have I am certain by his description of the craft that we witnessed the same thing.  Is there some way of digging a little deeper into this?  Oh...I don&apos;t want what I reported to be put out to the public...it&apos;s really embarrassing.Thanks((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",
20100320,20100320," Tampa, FL", unknown,unknown,"abducted as a child in Tampa, FL, in the 1960sI was a sleeping elementary school age child, in my own room and in my own bed in Tampa, FL when suddenly, there was light in my room,except the room had no overhead light and I hadn&apos;t turned on the light next to my bed. This bedside lamp was the only normal source of light in this room. It was off but there was still much light. This had never happened before.I had a fast impression of someone being next to my bed. I saw, momentarily, what I perceived to be blue jeans on a man&apos;s lower body then, with the light still on, but no one next to me,there was suddenly a lot of noise and commotion.In the next instant, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; record played very loudly, presumably from the little portable record player in our living room. My room shared a common wall with the living room. When it went on, I sat bolt upright in bed. My first thought was that someone was there to murder us but I dismissed that idea with the thought that murderers probably didn&apos;t make all of this commotion-a killer would be quiet.The music was turned up so loudly that I couldn&apos;t believe that my siblings would do something this unusual and dangerous, knowing how violent our parents were. Whichever child was doing this was risking a horrible beating FOR SURE.I touched my bedroom wall with my hand to prove to myself that I was awake. The wall was solid and normal and I could see and feel the paint. I believed I was awake and I laid back down, in terror. Someone was present and making a tremendous amount of ruckus. I was shaking.Then there was a staticy feeling in the air. The room was now dark, the music stopped.I went into shock when I then saw 4 grotestue, blue, wrinkled troll-looking beings in what looked to me to be blue overalls. They were lined up in front of my closet. I thought they looked like drums because they were as stout as they were tall. They weren&apos;t tall like a human, they were maybe 3 1/2 - 4 feet tall9maybe smaller) and so wide they were like squares.I must presume that the light must have been back on for me to see them so clearly, to be able to make out color but I didn&apos;t think about the light. I was rapidly processing that these were real aliens and this event was really happening, then I was paralyzed.I felt like every molecule in my body was being pulled through the soles of my feet. I fought with all of my will but could not stop the paralysis or the pulling, which was happening very fast. I was totally and completely terrified.The next thing I can remember is being on a grate-type bridge walkway that went into a building or something large. I had the thought that &quot;this is definately happening to me and no one, not even my mother, will ever be able to help me. I wondered if they were going to keep me.Then, things get confusing in my own ability to be sure of the order of any of the following things that happened.In the place with all the grating, someone was somehow, maybe telepathically telling me that there was a problem somewhere. I was shown a darkened room with giant preying mantises just walking around. I think there was a window or something between me and them because they didn&apos;t seem to notice or care about me in any way.Then I was shown a cloaked being in the same room I was in, who I automatically presumed was an old what-ever-she-was because she was very wrinkled and seemed very weak. I was shown this from a perspective of first being behind &quot;her&quot;, to her right. I saw the dark cloak then the being who was at my side walked me up to look at her face. He told me more about the problem these beings had but its vaque to me. My impression was that whatever the problem was it had led to her appearance and weakness.I remember being in a smaller craft, seeing the stars go by very fast through a window, feeling very alone, and once again realizing that this was real. I definately thought then that I was the only human in this craft. They didn&apos;t treat me like a child. There was no comfort offerred, no food, no water, no blanket and no one to help me. It was all matter-fact, like in this transport the beings were just performing a normal routine thing.Again, I&apos;m not sure of the order of events as I only have snippets of scenes in my memory.I remeber walking, with no resistence and not much fear, concern or even interest now. I just went along willingly. I don&apos;t know who was with me at this point but my best recollection is of someone short.We passed two human-looking beings to our left. There was a little girl with dark brown or black hair just kind of standing to the left of a large glass cylinder. A human man with dark hair was in the large cylinder. It looked like a large test tube. They didn&apos;t take any significant notice of me and oddly I now realize, I didn&apos;t make any effort to communicate with them. We never made eye contact. I never even tried to.As we kept walking, he(?), the being, now on my right, continued telling me I don&apos;t remember what-until he had me look down at small horizontal portals or screens that showed different military things including an arial view of a large rocket with smoke and &quot;things&quot; flying around it. My impression was &quot;war&quot; I felt sadness and I definately said or thought loudly &quot;If you know all this, show me how I&apos;m going to die&quot; and he did. He showed me a larger vertical screen and I watched myself, as an adult woman with long dark hair walking alone into a high floor of a ski chalet. There was a large picture window and I looked out upon a beautiful scene below of trees and lots of snow.Now, at this point, I feel more like I&apos;m living it rather than watching it. I walked toward the main living room type area. Maybe 8, 10 people were in the living room, most sitting on sofas and some just milling about. I remember thinking that there should be no problem here because I knew most or all of the people. I started to walk to a sofa to sit down and a man just came up behind me and slit my throat. It felt like a true event happening in real time. I felt like I was blacking out, dying, and my last thought in this scenario was &quot;I can&apos;t believe this could happen. I know all of these people. Why isn&apos;t someone helping me? Was this a plot they were all in together?&quot;.Then I was back, standing in front of this vertical scene, with the being who had no emotion about my death scene. None. I asked so he showed me. It was just a matter of future history, nothing personal on his part in any way.From there, things are very &quot;fuzzy&quot;.I felt like I was lying down, in a different place, kind of flooating, then on(?) a white table, with doctors around me and the table, mostly to the left side of me. I felt euphoric-a feeling I would now liken to a narcotic only more exaggerated.One of the doctors said my name!  I felt something like a metal rocket-shaped &apos;thing&apos; being inserted. I was somehow okay with this!  The next memory is of me in a small spaceship, traveling in my parent&apos;s yard to my bedroom window.The being piloting, to my left, was very blond and looked almost like a human male adult but my sense was that he was not human. His skin was too white-opague and his demeanor was like &quot;nothing&quot;. There only seemed to be room for the two of us in this craft but I could see all around us. I think he telepathically mentioned ants and aloe vera as we flew over some. I&apos;m not sure if I really remember the aloe vera-ant thing or if I conflabbed it.We were very low to the ground. We neared my window and I thought &quot;Oh, we&apos;re going in my window&quot; but we did not.Still in the small craft, I remeber vividly that I felt very raw (emotionally, not physically), invaded, disappointed, very saddened. Something had been taken from me, from my body. I felt a sad emptiness and the being imparted to me &quot;Its done. There&apos;s nothing you can do about it&quot; My regret seemed to surprise or confuse this being. Maybe even irritation would describe his affect. This was the only millisecond of &quot;feeling&quot; that I received from him. &quot;Disturbance of the norm&quot;  I heard two whistling, spinning noises, I felt cold, I felt a little spinning then I SAW my own bedcovers UNDER me as I flew into place in my own bed.I don&apos;t recall waking up that morning but I obviously did and just went about the morning like it was a normal day.I remembered later in the same day that this had happened. I was walking from my elementary school lunchroom, in line with my classmates, headed back to class when I remembered. I knew the word schizophrenic and knew if I told my mother she would take me to a psychiatrist and that would be what they would say.I knew it had really happened but believed I was the only person in all of history that this had happened to or would happen to.I made my mind up on that sidewalk that day that for my own protection, I could never tell a living soul.I have no idea if this was one event or numerous events that my mind has spliced together. I only remember the paralysis and sucking through the feet feeling happening one other time. I was even more terified the second time and totally determined not to go again. With all my will and strenghth, I moved my right little finger and the paralysis was broken.I&apos;ve never had the feeling again, never been taken anywhere and have had no conscious awareness of any aliens anywhere since then.The most important thing I can tell you is that when I returned home from school that day and went to use our restroom, I had a straight red line from my naval to my pubis. It was shocking to me but also forced me to admit the reality of this whole thing to myself. The red line looked like a perfect surgical incision had been made and closed but there were no suture marks, no staples, no apparent source of closure. The red line was perfectly straight and is visible to this day. It has become a thin brown line visible from about 3 inches from my naval down to the top of the pubis. I definately welcome inspection of this &quot;scar&quot; by medical researchers. No doctor or boyfriend has ever noticed or commented on it.Later, maybe 5 or 10 years later when I first read of animal mutalations, I had chills and anxiety. I felt certain this was the work of the beings who took me.I was a straight A student but a compartmentalized nervous wreck from then until recently. I could not become truly emotionally connected to anyone and I lived in complete terror that something like this would happen to my own daughters.When they came to take me the second time, I felt I was marked in some way or how would they know to take ME again?  Since in the death scenario I had long dark hair and was an adult - once I became an adult I dyed my hair blond, kept it short and knew I would never live in or go to places with ski chalets and snow.Now 54, I find myself in Colorado because I need to live near my oldest daughter who lives here. She is my primary care giver and I truly need her help - so I&apos;m here. I have a devastating terminal disease.Prior to this disease I now have, I lived only in hot places -FL and NV I was so determined to not live out the death scene.I have neuromyelitis optica and I am now blind. My immune system is shredding my nervous system one cranial nerve at a time. This began in the 80&apos;s.It is a very rare disease and one of the few conditions that causes both blindness and paralysis in the patient, then leads to death by the failure of the intercoastal muscles. I hated the beings my whole life. I hated that they took an innocent, already traumatized child without even asking the child. It was a violent kidnapping in my opinion.Now that I am aware of so many stories similar to mine, I&apos;m calmer in one respect(I&apos;m not the ONLY one) but now, I&apos;m very concerned for all humankind. What is going on?!  I have been diagnosed with PTSD from chilhood abuse and adult onset PTSD from going blind. A more correct diagnosis would have been lifelong PAS, I have no doubt.To clarify one of answers regarding number of craft seen-I said 3. I may have seen one from the outside, in my yard, during the same event but everything else was inside a craft. I count them as 1-the grating &amp; preying mantises, the little girl, the death scene and the medical stuff 2-the craft in which I was flown rapidly by a military type &quot;crew&quot; and 3- the tiny ship from which the blond took me across the yard and into my room.I had a horrible childhood in every possible way because of the on-going anxiety and terror from this event, the constant beatings from my adoptive parents and a year of molestation by my 5th grade teacher.I became a life-long loner.In the 90s, I told one friend and both of my daughters of the event. All three said they believed me, which makes it possible for me to tell you now.I also told a boyfriend who was a paramedic and is now a nurse in a infant and children&apos;s trauma ward in LV. He did not believe my story was real but does believe that I believe it. He believes that this is a cover story created by my mind because I cannot accept that I was raped as a child. He doesn&apos;t believe in UFOs and thinks we are alone in this vast universe.I was NOT raped as a child. Beaten by parents, molested by a teacher but there was no rape event.I can&apos;t really care if anyone believes me or not. It doesn&apos;t change any of what happened.I feel like my whole life was stolen from me. I&apos;ve not had one day since the event that I felt normal or that I fit in anywhere. There is some relief in knowing that people, lots of people worldwide, now know of these kinds of abductions and that there is at least investigation being done now.I used to pray that one day there would be a registry or someway to tell legitimate researchers and scientists what happened to me in the hope of one day really understanding why they picked me.Because I believe it neccessary for my good mental health to forgive them, I do, to a point, but I still hate the little, blue drum-like ones who took me with absolutely no regard for me, my terror, my youth.I like to think that if they ever came along now that I wouln&apos;t be frightened of them. I think I would be bold and demand some answers this time.I worry about, but also look forward to some kind of event where all the abductees are made known to the world so people will know that this really happened to lots of us and perhaps, is still happening to some people, especially children.I believe I saw 6 different kinds of aliens : 1-the horrible little blue drum-like ones who took me, 2-the preying mantises,3- the &quot;crew&quot; of the shuttle 4-the &quot;explainer&quot; who walked me past the two humans and showed me the &quot;war&quot; pictures and my own alleged death. 5- the doctors and 6-the very white man who took me home through my ceiling.Very oddly, I have no direct recall of any of the &quot;greys&quot; with the big eyes, claimed by so many abductees but I also can&apos;t tell you what the&quot;crew&quot; or the &quot;explainer&quot; or the doctors looked like at all. I don&apos;t know why I can&apos;t remember something this important, but in 40+ years I&apos;ve never remembered their faces.I was adopted at birth from McDill AFB and have speculated that the doctor who knew my name might have been a human military doctor.In 1979 I had to have an emergency surgical procedure (a right oophorectomy) because my right ovary had become gangrenous from &quot;torsion of the tube&quot;. No eggs were visible in this ovary upon removal nor upon follow-up microscopic examination. No doctor was able to explain this or determine where my eggs were,  or if there had ever been any in that ovary.I had a normal pregnancy in 1980 and gave birth to my second daughter. She has extra vertebrae in her neck and was born with eyes so almond-shaped I worried for a time that she might be mongoloid. She is not.In 1983, following the 1979 removal of my right ovary and a 1982 surgical procedure to eliminate some of the remaining left fallopian tube to insure contraception, and with my partner having had a vasectomy, I was told that I was pregnant again. I lost the baby and all the attending physician would tell me is that the baby was not normal. I was not shown the baby.In 2008, following 7 years of total menopause and having no partner for 8 months, as my boyfriend had died, I was again told I was pregnant. I was 52 years old. I was hospitalized for 3 days and all 12 blood pregnancy tests came back positive, as well as all urine tests. The hospital lab was in a bit of an uproar about &quot;the old, blind pregnant lady with no partner&quot;. I was released into the care of my family practioner who administered a blood pregnancy test in her office two weeks later. It came back negative.(The emergency room doctor seemed extremely interested in the fact that I had torsion of the tube in my 20s but he never elaborated. He just seemed very excited and interested in this fact. So much so that I wondered then and I wonder now, WHY was this of so much interest to him? As his name is on the medical record as the admitting doctor, I hope one day someone will ask him why this was a big deal to him. No other medical professional has ever raised an eyebrow when I mention it, yet he was incredulous and focused on it at length. He then performed an ultrasound and determined that my womb was empty. He admitted me, baffled).Because I had chemotherapy in 2007-09 for this neuromyelitis optica, my doctor believes I was experiencing endocrine changes. I think this is likely correct as I have had no other encounters since the 60s of which I am aware.Truthfully, I think the neuromyelitis is a result of both the chil abuse and the abduction. I think it was all too much for my nervous system. I see a very qualified neuro-opthomologist who has no idea at all why I have this disease.I&apos;ve never had the courage to tell any medical professional treating me or any mental health professional of the abduction because I believe they will label me &quot;insane&quot;.I&apos;m not.I have been troubled and anxious for 40+ years. I have attempted suicide too many times to count (okay, 5). The most recent event, in 2008, was a compulsive act that I felt was not entirely of my own accord.Suddenly, one afternoon, I wanted very much to put a screwdriver through my left wrist, which makes absolutely no sense to me. I did not do that but with almost an uncontrollable intensity, I took an over-dose of Wellbutrin and Prozac. Somehow, I took just the right combination for the drugs to balance each other out and though I spent the night in intensive care, I had almost no effect from the 15 pills or more that I ingested. No nausea, no vomiting, no convulsions, not even a hiccough. I can&apos;t believe how out of control of myself I felt while taking the over-dose. It was a manic event that still doesn&apos;t make sense to me. Never have I heard of &quot;death by screwdriver&quot; and I&apos;m no handyman. Usually, I don&apos;t even own a screwdriver and have never at any other time thought about a screwdriver in any odd way like this.I am a mother. If I were really going to intentionally kill myself there is no doubt that I would leave lengthy letters of explanation for my adult daughters. I would make logical plans, I would give away treasured momentos, I would say good-bye to those I love, yet, I didn&apos;t do any of this. I just felt  this over-whelming impulse to put a screwdriver through my own wrist. Instead, I took lots of pills very quickly. I remember counting 12, 13, 14...like they were M&amp;Ms, instead of strong medications.I was a medical professional myself (an EMT and medical writer) and NEVER would I do this.And yet, I did.The other 4 attempts prior were clustered from 2001 to 2004 and were also compulsive acts. No planning, just action that seemed to be out of me instead of from me. I tried to jump off a mountain (my daughter decked me to keep me from doing this), I ran out into traffic (everyone stopped), I went to a desolate location in an attempt to die from exposure and starvation (this was clearly going to take a long time and be painful) and I asked someone I didn&apos;t know to get heroin for me so I could over-dose. I took twice the amount they said would be dangerous and waited. All I got was a headache.Obviously, I&apos;m not very good at suicide.I don&apos;t think I will ever try again because now, if I felt the compulsion, I would resist totally.Enough of my life has been taken from me by others.Once I made the connection that the US military was probably involved in this, which was only recently, I began to feel much stronger but also even more angry. What do I think? I think I was taken by aliens but that the doctor who knew my name was human and that both were somehow benefitting from whatever they did to me. I truly think I was selected because I was an adoptee from an AFB and was already traumatized.Obviously, all of the medical information I am recounting is verifiable through medical and hospital records, which I&apos;m happy to provide to any legitimate researcher. I welcome the opportunity to have truth serum administered and would agree to be hypnotized by a medical professional. In both scenarios I would ask that a video recording be made of the entire questioning procedure and I would want a trained UFO researcher present in both cases.Its taken my whole life to put these snippets together. I remembered some of it that day but was an adult before I realized why I always had to have a rectangular white dining table. I could almost remember but not quite, then one day in Sarasota, FL, following the purchase of my 3rd or 4th white rectangular table, I remembered. I was on one. I think it possibly emitted white light. How else would I know it was white if I was lying on it? I don&apos;t remember anyone removing my clothing, nor do I know how my clothing was returned to my body.Unlike the other stories I&apos;ve been reading on the Internet, I was not shown any babies or told anything about hybrids. I wasn&apos;t asked to touch or hold anything or anyone.I now think they took eggs from my right ovary and I think they left the fallopian tube and ovary malpositioned which resulted in the torsion. It might have been intentional because the gangrene certainly made it impossible for doctors to tell what had happened to my right ovary and eggs.I believe they take children because we are closer to their size.Even now as I write this, I feel sick to my stomach and sweaty.I would give most anything to know the whole truth of what happened to me - and apparently others- and WHY.Finally, let me say that I am a professional writer and have been virtually my whole adult life. If I were going to make up a story, I promise you, it would make a lot more sense than this. I WISH I was making it up.Though it happened to me, it remains almost too incredible for me to believe but the scar is still there.Before she passed in 2003, my mother and I spoke of the scar. All she really said was &quot;yeah, you have had that for a long time.&quot; I don&apos;t know why she said this because NEVER did I show it to her or tell her about it in any way. She never commented if and when she really ever saw it, yet she acted like &quot;yeah, aliens, no big deal.&quot; No surprise, no questions.I thank you with my whole heart for providing this forum to people like myself who have kept this horrible secret inside ourselves for our whole lives. I hope someone will contact me and help me sort it out.Due to the blindness, phone contact is the best way to reach me. I would accept a collect call but I only have a cell phone and they don&apos;t permit collect calls. I can&apos;t read my own e-mail and must have others read it for me. I would prefer not to have to talk about it with anyone except a valid researcher.Thank you very much - and if you are connected to the military in any way DO NOT contact me. And I better not have any MIBs hanging around once I submit this to you. I am so NOT even kidding. If I am contacted by ANYONE except a UFO researcher, I WILL DENY that I wrote this and swear that it never happened.If you are truly valid UFO researchers, I hope you will know by content that this DID happen. Please give me a chance to provide the little proof that I have (the scar).((NUFORC NOTE:  Witness indicates that date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

It was about 100 feet up from where we were standing, and made absolutely no noise.  It had a tail of light. It streaked down towards the city, moving much too fast to be some sort of human aircraft, and way too low, plus you would be able to hear the engine from that distance.

From the moment I stepped outside, my dogs were acting jittery, and I too felt like I was being watched. So I looked around at my surroundings, and saw no one. Then as I started to mumble to myself that it was probably just nothing, I heard like a whirring kind of noise. So I rechecked the area and no one was in sight, that is until I looked up. In the sky maybe 90 feet over, and above my head I saw the believed UFO. I stared at it in silence, and disbelief  for a few minuets when my dogs got worse.  It looked like a round disked, circle shape, with a rounded hump, or top, on the surface of the aircraft. Outlining the shape of the bottom surface, were glowing, no flashing red, and yellow-orange lights. It was flying in a downward angle as if to land in the vast abandoned cow-field not so far away. So I ran inside and asked my sister&rsquo;s boyfriend if they (humans), had designed a mo! del like the one described above.  He simply shook his head and said no.  I was scared, and shocked. I had never believed in said &ldquo;aliens&rdquo;, or &ldquo;UFO&rsquo;s&rdquo;, until that Tuesday night, that I saw a horrifyingly real, UFO, or alien aircraft.  I had never expected to see one, in all my life, and especially not in my own yard, flying, too low to be permitted to pilots from this world, above my head!",
20100322,20100322," Bellmar, NJ", triangle,1 hour,"delta shaped object, missing time  I was perhaps 3 or 4 years old, which would make it 1965 or 1966.  It was Christmas Eve.  The location was Bellmawr NJ.  It was very late, possibly midnight or later.  It was snowing lightly.My family was just leaving my aunt&rsquo;s house at a Christmas Eve get-together, exchanging gifts, etc.  It was very late.  It had been snowing lightly but steady enough that there just a dusting of snow on the car.  My father cleared the windshield off quickly with his hands.  I remember this because he didn&rsquo;t have enough to make a snowball to throw.We started toward the end of the street (St Charles Street, facing southeast).  At the moment we came to the street&rsquo;s end (St Egbert st) a very, very large black/gray delta shaped object appeared over the tree tops (there used to be a field there, now occupied by homes).  The delta shaped object was very low, perhaps just two hundred feet, and moving slowly enough that it was almost hovering &ndash; heading or facing northwest.  It was large enough that it obscured most of the sky.  It was silent.  The leading edges of the delta shaped object were brightly lit in what at the time seemed the strangest possible way.  A single light on each of the two leading edges ran the entire length of the leading edge.  It emitted collimated &lsquo;sheets&rsquo; of light, which slowly swept across the ground, homes, and trees from each leading edge.I was in the rear left seat, with a clear view out the car window.  My brother, three years older, had jumped across the back seat and his body weight was on top of me while he gawked out the car window on my side.  I remember my mother saying something, sounding emotional, frightened.  It was at the moment my mother said something that everything seemed to spiral down to some dream like state, like being drugged into unconsciousness.I became aware of four beings, three males and one female.  The female was speaking, or more like singing to me.  It seemed the three males were &lsquo;singing&rsquo; to everyone else...I mean everyone else in the area around the ship and car.  I became aware of the presence of our car from another perspective, perhaps looking down at it from some altitude, at the tops of the homes and trees.  The female voice kept singing to me.  It was the sound of a lullaby but had intense imagery and concepts attached to it.  I understood that I was to take it all in.Then I gradually became aware of being in the back seat of the car again.  My brother was no longer on top of me.  My parents were sitting perfectly quiet in the front seat.  There was no sign of the object.  My mother looked at my father and nudged him.  He looked at her, then grabbed the wheel, and just started to move, (the engine was still running) then suddenly stopped.  There was about three inches of snow on the car.  My father had to get out and clear the windshield and front of the car before we could go on.Around 1985 I asked my brother if he had any recollection of the event.  He stammered and said he had, but thought it was just a really weird dream or dreamlike memory.  My father had no idea, in fact, didn&rsquo;t remember Christmas Eve at my aunt&rsquo;s house.  My mother couldn&rsquo;t remember the event.  Oddly, my cousin, who was in the house that we left that Christmas Eve night, remembered that something weird happened, but couldn&rsquo;t remember what it was.  When I asked what kind of weird, i.e., walls melting weird or can&rsquo;t remember where she put the keys weird, she stated that she had dreams for many years of that night but wouldn&rsquo;t go on about what kind of dreams.  I felt that she didn&rsquo;t want to talk about her weird dreams.I&rsquo;ve been looking over the years for a record of a sighting in that area and time, would have been Christmas Eve, 1964 or 65, but have found none.  Seems inconceivable that no one else saw this event.  The area is very close to Philadelphia Int&rsquo;l airport.  However, at that time of night, the airport and tower would have been closed.  I&rsquo;ve wandered if the three male singing voices were a type of sedating effect over the general area.There is one sighting noted 12/24/65 in Davidsville, PA of a &lsquo;light,&rsquo; nothing more.I note that this doesn&rsquo;t seem to correspond to any of the typical sightings noted over the years.  But that is my memory of it.",

20100322,20100322," Ashtabula, OH", unknown,5 minutes and 9 seconds,"Bright object observed in the morning sky until it suddenly disappearedMe and my friend were at Walnut Beach in Ashtabula, Ohio sky watching. We noticed a bright object in the early morning sky. We focused my video camera on it, we then centered the object on the video cameras screen, then paid no attention to it. We then talked about what we had seen earlier that night over the lake, then turned back to the camera, and noticed that the object had moved. We continued to observe the object until it suddenly disappeared.We thought that the object could have been a star, or planet at first but quickly realized that the earth simply doesn&apos;t rotate fast enough to account for how far the object progressed across the sky, and even if it were a star or planet the path it would have followed across the sky would have been entirely different.We then thought about the idea of the object being a aircraft, however I did not see any anti-collision, landing lights, navigation lights, or wing lights that were blinking at a timed interval on this object. The object appeared to be pulsating with no predetermined order, and flashing an array of colors.I further concluded that the object could not have been a aircraft because the object was on a eastern heading towards the rising sun so with that being said after the objects lights went off, the sunlight would have reflected off of the aircrafts fuselage still allowing it to be visible.I am former Air Force, and I have been around a lot of different airframes. I&apos;ve seen many different aircraft in the sky, and I can identify all of the airframes the USAF currently has in service, along with a good portion of those in the civilian sector on sight. However this object doesn&apos;t appear to be any airframe I am familiar with. Let alone the object was traveling at a extremely low airspeed, which in most cases the majority of aircraft would have a very hard time trying to stay airborne at such a speed. Not to mention the object was either in or extremely close to the NO FLY ZONE located around the Perry Nuclear Power Plant near Madison, Ohio.I eventually lost sight of the object when it suddenly disappeared from sight. I saw it disappear with my own eyes, an my friend saw it disappear on camera. We managed to capture the object disappearing on tape and we analyzed it frame by frame the best we could. I will be posting the videos link and the images link for the frame by frame breakdown below so you can see what we witnessed for yourself.Video link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAPdTd7oZqk   Frame by frame breakdown: http://s773.photobucket.com/albums/yy20/robertg87/  Equipment: JVC Everio with tripod   Any advice, comments, ideas, or information as to what this object might be would be greatly appreciated.I am intrigued by this object and would love to have this footage analyzed but I have no idea on how to go about doing that.Thanks",

As it became closer it was obvious that the lights were blinking in a circular fashion around the bottom of what appeared to be a disc shape. The shape seemed to get lower until it was probably only approximately 100 meters above the car and continued straight along the path of the road heading in the opposite direction. Although it was difficult to judge distance and size accurately (since it was dim with only the light from some nearby buildings and street lights,) it seemed to be the size of a small rancher.I am not someone who was terribly convinced until I witnessed this.

The objects were just behind the mountain ridge on the west side. So it was on the other side of the ridge and down a long the side of it just slightly out of my sight. The El Paso ridge is for the most part barren and too steep for anyone drive on. Only helicopters could get to where the lights were located.Description: I could not see the craft itself, but the light coming from it was extremely bright. In order for human technology to reproduce how bright it was, it would need to be a large collection of flood lights in one place. I could just see the very edge of the light source, before the shape of the light changed and appeared to actually be two craft crossing paths over and over again. As the lights moved around, it would cast a lingering haze on the clouds nearby that would resemble a lightning strike in the sky (the light did not flutter though like lightning does, it was constant). The color was pure white, this never changed about it. There was no blinking lights that would suggest man made craft.I live nearby an airport, and have become very used to identifying different craft in the dark. None of our craft can produce such a bright light that far away. I see this ridge every night at the same time, it has never been there before. So these lights were probably not caused by any sporting event (also why would you have a sporting event at 1:45 in the morning?)",

After a great day of fishing we headed to the house to unload clean up and cook some fish.At around 9:00pm my father was frying some fish outside and my uncle and I were preparing some food in the house.  My father opens the outside door and calls us out to go outside quick! We run outside and he points to the sky.We were facing North and we saw at first 4 amber (lighter flame orange) orbs moving in towards land coming from the east (ocean side).  They were about airplane altitude but I would say just a bit lower in altitude.They were moving very slowly but at a semi constant speed but almost evenly spaced apart traveling in a straight line playing follow the leader sort of speak.  There was absolutely no sound!  No red or green lights which is mandatory for aircrafts, and the sky was clear of any cloud cover.  We could see all the stars out that night.As the first orb got to about mid sky, it gave off a soft pulse effect and zoomed out of our atmosphere at an incredible speed, almost instantaneously turning into a distant white star, then after a second it was absolutely GONE!  It did not break the horizon like any regular aircraft, this thing broke out of our atmosphere! The following 2 followed suit, doing exactly what the first one did in the exact point in the sky traveling in the same direction.  By the time the forth one was reaching the spot in the sky where the others had gone, 3 more same looking orbs popped out from the same direction from where the other 4 originated from.This time the first one after about 10 seconds of moving slowly following the same path as the others, decided to zoom out to the point of looking like a white star and came back as the orange orb really fast!  After, the 6th orb decided to do a little dancing zig zag side to side a couple of times then got back in line.  They all followed the same direction and broke out through the atmosphere 1 by 1.  Truly was an amazing experience.  Ive tried to think of all the things it could have been and I only have one answer&hellip;&hellip;UFO&rsquo;s.

I witnessed in crisp detail what this thing looked like even at night!,ive got a good sense of perspective and id say it was sixty to eighty feet in circumference completely round and covered in what looked like huge bunsen ! burners and individually these were changing fast from low to high flame,i realised this was what all the flickering was at a distance!.

20100325,20100325," Laconia, NH", changing,1hr 30  min.,"UFO Sighting in LaconiaMy name is D.  I am sixteen years old and I live in New Hampshire.  Last Saturday night I went out with my girlfriend, who lives in Laconia, when we had the following experience:  I was with her around 11.  We wanted to take her Mom&rsquo;s car because it was nicer and we wanted to go look at the stars.  We went to Fun Spot at the back parking lot in Laconia.  There were 8 cars already there when we arrived.  Little by little, the cars started leaving one by one.  We were the last car in the parking lot.  Then the lights of the parking lot and the lights of the houses around us and the lights of the houses down the street started to go out one by one.  Then my girlfriend noticed something blocking the moon and asked, &quot;What was that?&quot;  I knew it wasn&rsquo;t a cloud because it moved back against the wind and blocked the moon again.  I don&rsquo;t know how to explain this but it turns into a ball when it wants to slow down and move around quickly and when it wants to go fast, straight, it turns into a flat plate with maze box-shaped lined lights.  These were on all the time. The colors were dim yellowish white and did not change. I cannot tell whether these were part of the bottom or not.  It flipped a lot.  I did not know which side was right or up on it.  It was doing this over the trees  across the street from the parking lot.  It suddenly crossed the street towards our car. Its size was as big as 14 houses.  It was really quiet. That&rsquo;s when we had to leave.  But I did not have time to turn on the headlights.We put the clutch in to start the car and jammed it into 1st and floored it.  The front end got picked up and the car could not move.  We steered left and right but the car just kept on going up into the air. My girlfriend was scared and she had boogers coming out of her nose while I was cursing.  The car was going up and the back wheels were off of the ground. Then I looked out of my window and saw that the parking lot park lines started getting smaller. Both our windows were down this whole time.  The front windshield started to crack and shake and the cracks spread from the passenger side to the driver&rsquo;s side. It popped outwards like it was pulled out.Something yanked my wrist. Not aggressively.  And the whole time in my head something was telling me &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t panic,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be scared.&rdquo;  And it wasn&rsquo;t in English in my head but I got the meaning.   It wasn&rsquo;t a language &ndash; I don&rsquo;t know how to explain it.   And on my girlfriend&rsquo;s side, it had her half-way out of the window.   Her butt  was off of her seat, maybe one-and-a-half or  two feet?  and the car was pointed almost completely straight up at the stars &ndash; yet I saw no stars.Every time I tried looking at it, in front, a white film went over my eyes.  It was kind of like staring at the sun with your eyelids closed.  I could not hear her screaming but I know that she was screaming. My ears felt like they kept on popping from the altitude.  I couldn&rsquo;t hear.  The smell was like unbearable, like you want to close your nose.  It was spicy, like pepper-sprayish, and clean at the same time &ndash; it was a smell that you could stand but you would close your nostrils because it still smells bad.  When I tried to fight and get my wrist back in the car, that&rsquo;s when the grip got stronger.  It was pulling my left arm up out of the window &ndash; there was no pain but it was strong &ndash; &hellip;.  I was trying to fight off the grip on my wrist.  My tongue was numb.  The horn beeped  by accident and the grip got a little loose.  It beeped again in the struggle and my arm flopped down in the car.  My girlfriend also fell back in her seat and we realized we were still up in the air. ! It  took 2 seconds for the car to drop. When we dropped, the air bags came out.  We floored it  as fast as we could through the town.  It was almost a straightaway to go to my girlfriend&rsquo;s house with very few turns to take.  During this time, both of us couldn&rsquo;t stop crying.  We arrived at her house and her Mom asked, &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; All this took place from 11pm to 12:30 am.  It seemed like we were in the air for 10 minutes and it felt like it was forever.    Her Mom called the police, and a policeman came.The policeman did not believe us when we first told him what had happened until he looked at the vehicle.  There were no scratches or dents or anything.  He said that there was no reason for this to have happened to the car when there are no dents or scratches and no reason for the windshield to shatter and pop out the way it did. He had no explanation for why the windshield popped outwards. Also, when I went to open my cell phone in front of the policemen, I got shocked by it.On Monday, I went to my doctor to get a whole physical to make sure I was OK.  My wrist had a puncture wound while my forearm has a cut that is semi-circular and there&rsquo;s blood on it.  I do remember that when I first looked at my arm after I got it back in the car, it was red with blood.  But by the time we got to my girlfriend&rsquo;s house, there was no blood anywhere.  On the center consul of the car, there is an imprint of her hand.  I don&rsquo;t quite understand what the policeman said but it was something about the skin of her hand leaving an impression.Now, I don&rsquo;t like to feel bumps in the car, or feel anything that trembles like a boombox.  I don&rsquo;t want to be out in dark areas at night. I also don&rsquo;t like to walk out to my Mom&rsquo;s car, anymore, outside. &ldquo;",

Last Saturday night, my boyfriend D came up to see me and we went out.  When we got to Fun Spot, in Laconia, we parked in the back in the separate parking lot.  We turned off the car and it was totally silent.  We were just sitting there and I looked up at the moon.  I saw this weird black-shaped object.  And then, I said to my boyfriend,  &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; He looked up at it and he said, &rdquo;If it gets any closer, we need to leave.&rdquo;  I kept staring at the moon to see if it was just a plane or something.  It moved back across the moon.  It was huge and it looked like it was zig-zagging or changing shape.   I couldn&rsquo;t tell. He said, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s coming closer.&rdquo; It flew so fast over the trees getting closer to where we were. It felt like it was zeroing in on us.  It blocked the moon. And then, we started panicking and driving away.  I thought were were going to hit the Bingo building.  We turned left but it felt like we went off of a jump &ndash; you know that feeling? like we were on a rollercoaster?   And we were in the air.  I was trying to pay attention to everything that was going on but it felt like I couldn&rsquo;t.  When I looked up, everything was black.  The smell was not nice but it was like something you could stand.  It was an odor I&rsquo;ve never smelled before.  I heard absolutely nothing &ndash; it was silent.  I felt immobilized like I had no control over what I was doing or over my body.  I could see nothing.  It was like opening your eyes in a pitch black room.I felt really nervous and scared.  I don&rsquo;t remember crying or screaming.  I held on to the center console because I felt like I was lifted.  I was holding on so tight that my thumbprint is imprinted on the center console.  And then, when I finally realized what was happening, I was so close to the windshield that my body was going forward with my arms behind me.  Everything was black.  I heard a loud noise like a horn.  Once.   And then, the car just dropped.  I hit my eye on the dashboard and the airbags came out.  I couldn&rsquo;t believe what had just happened.   I held my face and I looked over at my boyfriend.  I saw that his left arm had blood. I said, &ldquo;Are you OK?&rdquo; I looked at the windshield and it was cracked, totally, but only on the passenger side.  I could see D but I couldn&rsquo;t see anything outside.  The only thing that made the car drop was the sound of the loud horn.  When the car dropped,  there was a loud boom.  After that, we just drove so fast out of there. The smell went away after we drove away.   And I started crying.  And  I said, &ldquo;What the h&mdash;l  just happened?&rdquo;  My boyfriend  said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;  I didn&rsquo;t feel like they were following us.When we got home, my Mom said that she could hear me from the outside while I was freaking out.  I couldn&rsquo;t stop crying.  My Mom said, &ldquo;Calm down and tell me what happened.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re never going to believe me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is it my car?&rdquo;  she asked.And I said, &ldquo;Let me explain,&rdquo; because I felt that if I didn&rsquo;t explain it fast enough, it was just going to go away from my mind.  At about 12:15 am, a cop arrived.  I told him what had happened while I was sitting down at the dinner table.   My boyfriend was sitting next to me &ndash; it was then that I noticed that there was no more blood on his arm or his clothing.  The cop didn&rsquo;t believe me at first until he finished looking at the car.  He told my Mom that there was no reason for the air bags to come out because nothing else on the car was damaged.  He didn&rsquo;t check underneath the car but we found out later that the underside was totaled.  The cop said that he was going to the place where we had been.I just felt thankful that we&rsquo;d gotten out of there.  But I couldn&rsquo;t stop crying for more than 2 hours afterwards.  My Mom said, &ldquo;You should go take a shower and get the airbag dust off of you.&rdquo;  But I didn&rsquo;t want to be alone at all.  I felt lucky.   And there were no scratches or anything anywhere on my body.The first night, my dream was that I was a little girl, maybe 6 or 7 years old, in an Elementary School classroom.  I was looking at myself as a little girl.  And then it was like the teacher called me up and I couldn&rsquo;t talk or say anything - but everybody else seemed to say something for me.  Like everything I wanted to say, everybody else was saying it except for me.  They were saying exactly what I wanted say.  I have never had a dream like this before &ndash; where I am a little girl and see anything about the past.  I did not feel right at all.I am better now. I still worry about seeing this thing again and I pay attention to the sky at night.  I really don&rsquo;t go out at night, anymore, because I&rsquo;m scared. &ldquo;",
20100325,20100325," South Bend, IN", unknown,3 minutes,"Object travelling in night sky below cloud deck eastbound illuminated (flashing &amp; steady) green, red, white &amp; shimmering violet light.This object was observed while driving in residential area north of the University of Notre Dame. Weather was overcast and object was below the cloud deck. What at first appeared (and was assumed to be) a very large commercial aircraft took on a very different appearance upon closer inspection.An impressive display of flashing lights is what caught my eye. Green and red lights similar to standard aviation craft were seen...however these were arrayed in larger numbers, particularly the red lights. A deep fluorescent violet light began to shimmer at one point along at least one edge of the object. As the object passed more overhead I could then see the bottom of it. On this aspect I could see a large bank of white lights (these were not bright white but had a somewhat warmer and yellow/orange tone) in a rectangular pattern. These somewhat shimmered and sparkled.The object was traveling due east at a steady but undetermined speed. My guess was that it was traveling at approximately 300 to 600 MPH (depending on the actual height of it).The object appeared to be quite large in that as it got further away, it did not really seem to diminish in size too much. On the other hand, it was below the cloud deck (the altitude of which I do not know), so sizing the object in that regard was not possible. I was driving alone and simply could not pull over in traffic to get a better look. There was a solid black background slightly visible behind these lights...so it was almost assuredly a solid structure that I was looking at.If I had to guess, my general impression was that the object had a somewhat triangular shape. The size of the object by pure general impression, would have been approximately the size 1 to 4 times the size of a Boeing 747. I lost sight of the object behind trees.The type of lights on the object were shimmering (violet), flashing (red and green), steady (red and green) as well as the steady yellow white rectangular lights which had a shimmering to sparkling aspect to them as well. The object, while in my view, did not behave any differently than that of an aircraft except that I have never seen an aircraft which was lit up in this spectacular fashion.  Very interesting. I found your site after wondering if I could locate a similar type of sighting.",
20100325,20100325," Lawton, MI", fireball,I only observed for 5-10,"Green glowing fireballs in the woods near Bankson Lake in Lawton, MII thought I had entered a report to this website a couple of years ago.

Something got me thinking about it again--every once in awhile when I wonder about it, I will do a search for &quot;fireballs&quot; &quot;ball lightning&quot; and &quot;swamp gas&quot; and the pictures and descriptions I find don&apos;t really describe what I saw.  I don&apos;t know what I saw.  I know it absolutely terrified me because I didn&apos;t know what it was, and it seemed to move with an intelligence, that is what really frightened me.  That it did not seem to be moving randomly or as something seen in nature, but like it was exploring and moving in a very deliberate way around the trees--up very high, down very low, close to our window, farther away.  Each time, there were 2+ balls, although I can&apos;t say exactly how many, because we were in a! cabin looking out the window and not getting a full vantage point.  Basically we were frozen in fear in our beds, watching out the window. The approximate size of the balls I would compare to an appliance like an average size washer or dryer or stove.  Even just writing about it and thinking about it makes me feel a little freaked out. I just did not get a good impression from these things.  Both times we saw it, it was sometime between midnight and 1 am, when we were staying up late talking with the lights out.  Both times we watched for awhile until we had the courage to jump up and turn the lights on (with the lights on you couldn&apos;t see out the window into the blackness).  Both times I checked the woods behind the cabin the next morning, and saw nothing but the most unremarkable leaves, trees, brambles...completely homogeneous, unremarkable woods for as far as you could see!!

Then we looked at each other in &quot;aw&quot; and we were just flabbergasted.

We saw something floating over the Pacific and moving towards the coast. It seemed to be coming from the west, heading slightly south east--perhaps toward Torrey Pines. It did not have the symmetrical shape of a hot air balloon, nor did it seem like a parasail craft. It was about 1/4 the &quot;size of a full moon.&quot; It looked to be dark blue, perhaps with some &ldquo;cardboard brown&rdquo; coloring&mdash;and no discernable markings. It had a cobbled-together appearance and if I was told it was a home-made craft, designed out of about a hundred card board boxes, and filled with helium I would think that was a viable possibility. There were no lights and no sounds. It appeared to be moving &ldquo;about as fast as a hot air balloon&rdquo; and did not appear to be under power.  As we finished our walk we kept an eye on it, and at one point it looked to be changing direction, heading more north-east. It seemed to be gaining altitude. Back at the house we found the binoculars but were unable to get a good focus on it.  My mother who was visiting from out of state tried the binoculars, too, but with no real success--it was too far away. Finally it changed direction again, and appeared to be heading more distinctly south east, toward the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station. Concerned that it might tangle with the flight pattern of the F-18&rsquo;s that fly out of Miramar regularly, we called the San Diego County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department, letting them know what we saw. While I was on the phone the object moved out of our sight. As for the background of the three witnesses&mdash;all of us are college-educated, two of us with graduate and post-graduate work as well.

The incident occurred somewhere between 5:15 pm and 5:25 pm.  It was a sunny day with a bright blue sky. It was cloudless.We were laying on our backs looking up at the sky.  I noticed a pigeon sitting on top of a lamp post that was in the park.  I noticed a small white object floating down to the earth.  I thought the object was a feather that had fallen from the bird.  For some reason, I was fixated on it and watched it float to the ground.I told my friend to look at the feather and pointed out that it was taking a really long time to hit the ground.  All of a sudden (and I know this sounds strange,) the &quot;feather&quot; went up higher in the air instead of coming down.   At first I thought a gust of wind blew it higher.Then, all of a sudden it appeared to shoot through the sky up and over to the right above some houses.  The way it was traveling did not seem plausible by Science.  It shot FAST across the sky as if the sky was sucking it in.  Like it was traveling through another dimension.I don&apos;t know if it was actually a feather that we noticed which drew our attention to the small white object or if the feather transformed into the white object.  But it flew SO fast and high and eventually disappeared.  As it got further away it looked less and less like a feather and more like a tiny white dot that was glowing. Like a shooting start that went up instead of down.  I hope this made sense.I looked around to see if anyone else in the park was noticing it but no one was.  My friend that was with me saw the exact same thing.  I had him describe to me in detail what he witnessed to make sure I wasn&apos;t seeing things.  He described it accurately.",

I have also seen things like advanced lazer technology with Huges Aircraft that would scare many people today! What I have come to understand is really simple. People do see things they can not explain or identify. But remember the F-117 first flew in 1969. The stealth single wing bomber around the same time. The F-71 Blackbird before that! Please tell me we haven&apos;t made any advancement in aircraft in nearly 40 years? I&apos;m fully convinced of UFO&apos;s but of our advanced military.

It caught my attention because it was orange, where usual helicopters have a white glow.  I stared at it for a few seconds and then it started dropping smaller white lights, and my first reaction was that it was dropping bombs.  I didn;t think it was a UFO at this point, I thought it was an army helicopter or other army aircraft.  I left my room to go get my mom;s camera and returned with her and the camera only to find that the mysterious orange light was gone.  I looked throughout all the windows in the house, it was nowhere in sight.  I thought about it and brushed it off as a helicopter dropping flares because it was the only logical explanation I could come up with.  This was at approximately midnight on March 27, 2010.About an hour later, I woke up and my window was still open.  It was then I saw that the smaller crafts that were dropped were all clustered and flying around in unusual patterns in the North West sky out of my window.  I looked at them for four hours and couldn&apos;t figure it out.  I&apos;m positive that they were what came out of the orange glowing craft.  They would fly diagonally, horizontally, vertically, and make turns that couldn&apos;t possibly be made by any aircraft here on Earth.  I seen them appear from point A to point B.  There was no trace of light as they flew because it was so fast.  They, like the orange UFO, were silent.  I watched them from 1:00 AM to about 5:00 AM then I thought I had enough and shut the blinds and tried to sleep.  I didn&apos;t see when, or if, they left, but I did hear a loud and unusually low jet fly by a little before sunset that woke me up.  I checked, and didn&apos;t see them anymore after that.The orange UFO was high in the open sky, and the white smaller ones were unusually lower than the mountain range that is outside my window.  Both the crafts looked like simple circular lights.  It was an extremely windy night so the sky was clear.I don&apos;t see how I could be the only one to see this, I&apos;m sure others seen it as well.  It lasted for hours.

It was partially hazy but almost completely clear around Mt. Lemon of the Santa Catalina Range north of the city. As soon as we stepped out of the house I heard a high pitched screech coming from the south (from Tucson). It was fairly high pitched but sounded like a commercial airliner. The aircraft(s) were in the haze traveling north. Since it was loud (so most likely low) and traveling in a heading not a major population center I will assume that they were A-10 Warthogs hailing from Davis Monthon Airforce base in Tucson (they have exposed turbofan jet engines and sound similar to commercial aircraft). I only saw on faint pair of lights and they were flying west by northwest and probably at low altitude. As the noise subsided, I looked towards Mt. Lemon and noticed ONE bright pulsating light coming from the northeast. It was brightly pulsating and at high altitude, pulsating at random intervals (sometimes many times in a second and sometimes one every two or three seconds). When it pulsated it appeared that their were green and red lights (one of each) in addition to many very small white lights on the sides of the objects. I am sure  that this was not an airplane as the red and green lights (like those on the sides of airplanes to indicate their port and starboard sides) as they were not constant and the white lights were not a planes landing lights as they were not constant or pulsating in constant time. Although it was hazy in most of the sky, the sky around Mt. Lemon and the rest of the Santa Catalina mountains was clear as the moon and numerous stars were visible  while only the brightest stars were visible in the rest of the sky. The craft appeared to spawn, as it sudd! enly appeared next to a star that I was viewing to the northeast. The craft travelled very quickly as it was able to transverse the entire mountain range in the course of about two minutes. As it progressed its strobing light gained in intensity. Although I can not say for sure, I would speculate that it flew at high altitude and was far to the north, most likely directly over Globe AZ. After about 30 seconds or so, a second identical object appeared behind and closer to the horizon, in relation to the first object. They were in constant formation and had a tethered appearance to it. The objects were definitely not satellites (as I&apos;ve heard of old tethered satellites) as they were very bright (brighter than the surrounding stars). Right before I went in the house to get the whole family to see (as only three other people were witnessing it) a third light appeared. The object was identical to the others but was far in front of the other two and was at an altitude (or locatio! n as I can&apos;t really speculate on its hight) in between that of! the oth er objects.

Just wanted to submit the photo in case anyone else ever see&apos;s or has seen something similar. The photograph clearly shows a few raindrops as it had just started to slightly rain (which I must say didnt last for long, the rest of the day was sunny but there were big rain clouds around) so you can easily compare the raindrop to the disk shape in the picture.  The conclusion of the photo analysis in my opinion left me with unanswered questions.",

At first, I thought it was a motorcycle; however, as it got closer I could tell it was something entirely different.  My car started to hesitate and all the light on my car suddenly went out.  I pulled my car to the side of the road and stopped.  All at once the light totally encircled my car it was very bright almost blinding and made me feel dizzy and nauseous.  I remember hearing a whooshing sound and feeling static in the air.  Seemed just a few minutes and it was ahead of me moving up the road.  I began to follow its direction and past my road, when it shot up into the air, then up over the lake, then was gone.  I guess it was probably about the size of a semi-truck only round about 15 to 20 feet across.  I pulled over again and sat there awhile wandering what?--again what was that?  When I arrived home, my sister asked me what took me so long to get home.  See it is only a 10 to 15 minute drive.  Evidently, this time my drive home took over 3 hours.  Now from the time I saw the object till the time I returned driving home, seemed to me only maybe 5 to 10 minutes.  I told my sister what had transpired and that I was getting scared because I had no idea what happened during the time I was encircled.  She said I sounding crazy.  But then we decided, I should call the police.  I did and they gave me another number to call because they said they had other sighting reports.  I called the other number the police gave me and gave them a full report of what I had experienced, They thanked me and said they would contact me if they needed more information-they never did.

I walked over and saw my heavy metal and glass furniture being lifted and tossed about like newspaper but i looked over toward my right and saw bright flashes of lights almost like fire over toward a heavily wooded area.  My first thought was a fire must have started over there but the way the bright lights were lighting up only that part of the sky seemed weird to me.  It seemed as if something on the ground over in that direction was projecting a light towards the sky in a cone shape not a natural shape as if it was a fire. Yet the lights kinda flickered like a fire with orange, pink, white and yellow colors.  This lasted for about fifteen minutes. I was stuck in place and suddenly i saw a round object shoot directly up from the spot that the lights were coming from into what seemed like clouds or fog.  At that same moment all the lights sort of sucked into the sky where the object disappeared and then total darkness as if no light were ever over there.  Seconds later a bright blue/green light flashed in the area of the sky where the object and the lights disappeared and the blue/green color lingered for a few seconds and sort of drifted off into the clouds or fog.

I thought maybe I can follow it with my eyes so I looked and sure enough I could see a craft moving at incredible speed.

It moved in from high up almost straight above me from NE to SE but it got bigger doing so.The object then began to move evasively like a stunt kite from East to West looking much bigger as it passed.It was the color of a faint star but as big as a silver dollar at arms length.Which is huge looking in the sky The light eminating from it was lightly visible but visible none the less.(I am stone cold sober always.)

On a cruise ship departed from Miami Fl, off the coast of Puerto Rico. My wife and I had returned to our balcony stateroom.  I stepped out onto the balcony just to have a look at the ocean and see if there were any other ships around. I did not see any other ships. What I did see were three red lights in the shape of a triangle,one light above 2 below, possibly 1-2 miles away, in the sky, probably 15 to 20 degrees above the horizon. The sky was clear with scattered clouds. At first I thought these three red lights were some sort of helicopter formation.I am an Air Force veteran, I quickly dismissed the helicopter formation as these light were, infact, perfectly stationary. They made no movement and there was no sound coming from them. I assumed that I was too far from the object to hear any sound anyway.I looked at the lights for maybe 5 to 10 seconds, watching for any movement and could not detect any. Next, I turned a! way from the object and looked around the sky , deliberately trying not to view the object. I once again found the object, still in the same location, unmoving. It was at that point that I called for my wife to come see this object. My wife had been occupied with doing something else and by the time she got to the balcony the lights just disappeared as I watched them.Just as though someone turned off a switch, as though turning off a light in a room. Gone! I have no understanding of how or where these lights came from. I can only say that they were real, not some transparent reflection of a common item which I mistook as something unexplanable. My immediate impression was of a helicopter or some sort of military aircraft, which I dismissed.

I watched it for about 30 seconds and at that point told myself that this did not appear to be an airplane due to how the lights looked now. So I decided to get my jacket on and just step outside for a momement. Now looking at this object I knew by seeing the lights moving across it and what appeared to be some kind of red laser type of light on the bottom, that looked like it was hanging quite someway away from the lights on top, that this was something that I have never seen before. I observed this for approx. 45 min. At times the lights appeared to be in a cross shape but most of the time it was just straight across with the red light on the bottom. This red light appeared to be going in a circular motion and just not oneway, in some kind of scanning mot! ion back and forth. The light that appeared from this object was white and sometimes blue lights running through the white. There were times that both ends of the light were lit up in blue also.

So i step outside and look up to the west and see the jet and the jet trail, but i&apos;m still hearing the nose and notice almost parrell is a second jet. some distance away i would have to say but seeing to jets matching speed and general direction strikes me as odd, and as they fade away under the tree line the noise i can still hear, and i look to the east, to 2 more jets. They&apos;re not to low, normal distance from ground for normal everday jets. Exceptthey&apos;re cruising quit fast, with both direction and speed i know they&apos;re niether circling to land at bradely nor west over.  I notice with the one now diretly over head from the wing span, general shape, and th! e spilt in each jet trail after the exuast that these birds have 2 engines per wing, and the cool flat grey of the air force, maybe a c-5 or a c-17 again not out of the ordinary, except they&apos;re going fast from an odd to vector to an unknown destination and even wehn we first entered the war in iraq i&apos;ve never seen more then 2 of these in the air like this at the same time.

I looked at the object and I was glowing bright white to orange to redish colors, almost as if it was on fire.  There was also a tail somewhat like a comet&apos;s tail coming of of the back of it.  The way this object moved though could not have been a comet, or a rocket.  My dad was watching it as well once I pointed it out to him.  He is a high level navy Senior Cheif and now works in a control tower for a nearby base.  The object sometimes just floated, there seemed to be no sound whatsoever, and then it would make complex movements left to right, diagnoly, straight down, up, any way it wanted.  This lasted about 2 minutes.I looked at the car in front of us and noticed the couple in the car were also pointing to the object in the sky.  Soon after the object made some more maneuvers.  Then as if having the ability to accelerate to what I believe to be the speed of light, the orb, craft, object whatever it may have been.  Shot off at an amazing speed and in a matter of 1-2 seconds completely disapeared.This image has stuck in my head ever since and I dont think I will ever get an explanation for what we saw that night.  My father contacted Langley to see if any launches were scheduled for that day and there was nothing.My father works with many top officials now that he is retired and now a civilian working on base in the control tower.  He knows what we saw that night was nothing at least in military arsenal that has been released.This area has seen many sighting since then...  Including the lights and explosion seen and felt over va / nc in the last couple months or so.",
20100401,20100401," New Kensington, PA", other,5-10 minutes,"Disappearing plane.I was traveling south on Route 28 at approx. 10 minutes to 8PM.  I exited at the Tarentum exit.  At the stop sign at the bottom of the ramp I looked to the right about 45 degrees.  Out of the front windshield just above the tree line I saw some whispy clouds.  They were orangish colored from the setting sun.  In front of the clouds coming over the trees heading due north was a very distinct chemtrail that was also orangish. (Sun reflection)  I have always been a sky watcher.  Especially since becoming aware of the chemtrails.  I&apos;m the type of person that notices things others wouldn&apos;t.  I don&apos;t drink or use drugs.  I consider myself a credible witness.I had to make sure I stopped because there was a cop car to my right watching the stop sign.  I noticed I was having trouble focusing on the chemtrail.  Normally they start as two trails coming from the wings and they quickly blend into one wide trail.  This one appeared to blink from one to two tightly side by side.  Everytime I blinked it was one then two tightly together.  At that time I could not see the plane making the trail which seemed odd.  I made a mental note about where is the plane.  It was time to move so I drove on making a left turn towards New Kensington.  This placed my back to the trail.Having to wait for the lights to change it took a few minutes to cross the bridge. My destination was at the end of the bridge.  I pulled in to the parking lot and headed to the back lot.  This again placed me facing the direction of the chemtrail.  I was looking to my left at a 45 degree angle.  It was still orange, thick and very defined.  Now I could see the plane.  It was sorta shaped like the U2 spy plane.  Very odd looking and black.  Normally the planes are white.Thinking back now about where I first saw the trails and their angle in the sky and now looking at them again something seems not right.  It&apos;s like they jumped over toward the east closer to my location but were still heading north.  I parked and got out.  I was watching the plane and couldn&apos;t wait for it to come toward my location.  It&apos;s present heading would have put it directly in front of me moving from left to right.  I really wanted a better look at the plane.  The trail it left was very thick and was not evaporating like a (vapor) contrail.  I knew this trail would last and I wanted to see how it spread out.  I went inside so I could unlock the door from the inside.  This took 1-2 minutes.  I came back out with great anticipation figuring the plane would be just about directly in front of my line of sight.I opened the door and stepped outside and the plane had  vanished.  The chemtrail was completely gone as was the plane.  I looked in front of the path the plane was on...nothing.  No evidence of the thick chemtrail it left behind. Everything was completely gone.  No cloudlike formations and no plane.  The plane with the speed it was traveling would have easily been somewhere in my field of vision without turning my head.  The thick chemtrail from my many previous observations would have lasted hours and spread across a wide area of sky.When I saw the trail after entering the parking lot it looked like the chemtrail started a few inches behind the plane like it may have just been switched on, again a little odd considering the time it took to cross the bridge.  I should have been able to see it stretch way out behind the plane.Remember the trail blinking and changing from one to two?  And the trail seemingly shifting positions to the east?  No plane visible in front of the trail and then it was.  The plane was not as high as they usually fly.  At first I thought it was very high and that&apos;s why I didn&apos;t see it.  When it did appear it was big and much lower than they normally fly.  And looked black.There is no way the plane changed direction.  I would have been able to see it make any turn.  From that vantage point you can basically see horizon to horizon.  It literally vanished into thin air without a trace like someone flicked a switch.  I think it may have been jumping locations in the sky.Reporting a UFO is one thing.  The government can dish out a swamp gas cover story.  Reporting disappearing planes puts it in a different ballgame.  I&apos;m afraid I&apos;ll get a visit from someone.How did they make the chemtrail instantly invisible too?  Stealth on steroids?  Cloaking?  Keep looking up.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

We started the night looking at the Orion nebula.  I have a book of star charts and had my head in it trying to see what else in the area would be interesting to look at.  My cousin pointed to an area in the west southwest sky (Taurus the bull)  I pulled my head from the book to look in the direction she was pointing.  From the left of Taurus +30 deg heading due north toward Polaris were three dull green lights traveling at a rate at that of a satellite.  We were only able to track the lights for about 10 seconds before they were lost behind the trees in my backyard.  I immediately began looking for a logical explanation as to what they were.  I have been actively stargazing for the last five years and in that time I have seen many satellites.  Never have I seen satellites traveling in this pattern(unless NASA has launched some sort of weather satellites I wasn&rsquo;t aware of).  The pale ! green color was also an abnormal color which I have never seen in an orbiting satellite.  To put it simply this event has rendered me clueless as to what myself (Age 31) and my Cousin (Age 9) saw.  One other side note as to the shape of the lights; they were orb shaped.  they were like what one would see when the space shuttle would pass over head bit at a much lower magnitude in brightness.  As for the distance apart from each other;  If you would hold your hand at arms length and make the victory symbol(or peace sign)and measure the distance apart from your index to your middle finger, that&rsquo;s the distance they were apart.  From the ground they looked like the following demonstration:    (  .           .             . )   Please do not treat this as a false report.  If anyone who reads can present to me a logical explanation to what we saw, I invite your reply.  I am not reporting this looking for attention in any way.  I, for now am treating this event for what it was: an! Unidentified Flying Object.  Until it is otherwise identified! it will remain a UFO, Not aliens or visitors from far off, but simply a UFO.

There has to be a rational explanation for this sighting.  I&apos;m sure there is.  And I&apos;m really curious to identify it.I&apos;m in Valencia, CA.  After midnight on March 27, 2010, I came upstairs and immediately noticed a blue light (like a huge glowing LED) emanating from outside the large window in the baby&apos;s room.  Looking outside, I could clearly see three rows of brilliant blue lights hovering low to the ground over the mountains -- perhaps a mile away.  I had an eerie sensation seeing this unidentified object, as I had never seen anything like it before.  The mountains are free of houses or any man-made structures, so it was completely out of place and very prominent.I immediately ran to grab my Sony Cyber-shot.  After taking a few pictures, I tried to take a video, but it was not very clear.  So I ran downstairs and got my Panasonic DVX-100 and started filming with that.  The video doesn&apos;t begin to do it justice, but at least it&apos;s something.  You can see a blue-lit object just hovering there.  From what I could make out, there were 3 rows of brilliant blue lights and one pulsating red light at the top in the middle.  (You hear me describe this on the video.)  There appeared to be slight movement or rotation, but I can&apos;t say that with any certainty.After the camera battery ran out, I watched the object for a few more minutes and then went back downstairs and tried to convince myself that there was a rational explanation.  I came up fifteen minutes later and the object was still there.  Went to bed soon after, so I&apos;m not sure how much longer it stuck around.  Kicking myself for not continuing to watch, but quite frankly, I couldn&apos;t quite believe what I was seeing.  It was only the following morning when I reviewed the footage that it really began to sink in.To be certain, I recorded video out the window at the same time the following two nights, but no lights appeared.  I searched around online to see if anyone else reported a similar sighting.  It looks like there were two other reports on or around March 27 -- one in Tracy, CA and one in Blue Lake, CA.  Specifically, I believe both of those reports also cited the pulsating red light atop blue lights.I have both video and pictures of the object.

20100405,20100405," Crestline, CA", disk,2 minutes,"Bright UFO between 2 jetsUFO Sighting Report     March 15/2010     by ((name deleted))I was going to my first day of training for the US Census which was to take place in Green Valley Lake which is in the San Bernardino Mountains of California.  I live in Crestline, California. My training started at 8:00am so I had to leave Crestline about 7:00am.  As I was leaving my home, traveling East along Lake Drive, close to Lake Gregory, I spotted three objects in the morning sky. It was a clear day and the sun was rising. I was about a block from having to make a right turn onto Lake Gregory Drive towards Hwy 18 when I spotted 3 flying objects.  I immediately slowed down and glanced in the rear view mirror for just and instant to see if there were any cars behind me.  I knew I had to make a turn at the stop sign and would possibly lose sight of them, so I milked the moment and took my time getting to the stop sign.  The objects were right in front of me and I had a perfect view through the front windshield.   2 of the objects were jets and the other was a bright glowing ! disc or sphere like UFO which was traveling right in between the 2 jets, flying about the same speed.  The jets had their after burners on and I could see the exhaust trail very clearly behind them.  The UFO on the other hand had no after burner or exhaust of any kind.  They were about 2:00 high and about 30,000 to 40,000 feet up.  The jets were small in comparison to the UFO which seemed to be about twice their size. The UFO looked like a bright planet or star, which is what I thought it was at first, but then I realized because it was right in the middle between the two jets and moving along with them, it could be neither.  Because the UFO was so bright, I thought the UFO might be reflecting the morning sun but the jets undersides were not reflecting the sun so I deduced that the UFO was lit up on its own accord. I could very well be wrong about that but I figured that the jets being a much duller silver would have been lit up by the sun as well, but they weren&rsquo;t. I couldn&rsquo;t ! tell if they were Military jets but they appeared to be so. Th! ey defin itely were not passenger planes and they were moving much to fast.  At first the UFO was centered on each side of the two wings of the both jets then as a few seconds passed, it lagged behind a little until it was near there tails.  I could make out the UFO more clearly then the jets because it was very bright and much larger and round. The contrast was exiting. I estimated the distance between the two jets and the UFO to be about a &frac12; mile to a mile on each side. The UFO seemed to darken a little from a bright starry silver to a shiny metallic silver. At one point it looked as if it had blinked off and on very quickly, right before it disappeared. It also seemed to get brighter right before it blinked out. This happened right before my eyes as the two jets kept on the same direction. I was amazed when it did this but this was not the first time I have seen UFO&rsquo;s and I have seen them make this kind of maneuver before.  In fact I have seen them much closer as close as 100 feet! .  Back to this sighting, I was glued to this UFO the whole time then it was just gone. This happened right before I made the right turn onto Lake Gregory Drive. I watched a bit more and waited to see if the UFO would blink back in but it did not. As I continued to visually follow the jets I felt a thump as I went off the road onto a burm that was on the right. This happened about a block after I made the right turn. This spectacle had my full attention and I was fortunate that I didn&rsquo;t hit anything on the right side of me other then dirt.  I put on the brakes and came to a stop along side the road, still not taking my eyes of the 2 jets. The 2 jets kept on flying in the same direction with the after burners still on and then gradually they disappeared over the top of the mountain ridge. This took about another minute. I also noted that the exhaust contrail behind the jets were the same, which was about two inches long, so I assumed they didn&rsquo;t change there speed during the! entire sighting. The jets also did not change direction or di! stance f rom each other the entire time. I concluded that the jets where either escorting this UFO or chasing it. In any case because the UFO fell behind a bit of the jets and the jets didn&rsquo;t slow down with it, it appeared that the UFO was in full control of the situation. I continued to watch a bit more after the jets and their exhausts contrails were gone hoping the UFO might appear somewhere else, but it didn&rsquo;t as far as I could see. I had to get to my training class and drive a little faster to make up for the lost time. I did not tell anyone at training but I did tell my family when I got home. Later on that week, I told a couple friends who are UFO buffs. It was an interesting sighting to say the least.",

I continued to watch it, thinking, &ldquo;Wow, what a bright light.&rdquo;  I really was brighter than any plane light I have ever seen.  It was only one color (a yellowish white, not a bluish white).  It was then I thought why is there no flashing?   The light stayed solid the whole time.Then as I kept watching, I waited to see if it would change or get closer or keep going to the side so I could see what sort of plane it was.  But, I was amazed to notice that it never moved.That really startled me, so I really now strained to keep an eye on it for about 30 more seconds&hellip;no movement.  As I was driving on the freeway, I had to occasionally divert my eyes back to the road, and at that point I did once again, but when I looked back, the light was gone.

About 12 pm.My grandson and I were staying in my sailboat, located in Punta Gorda Fl.  I had him take the front bunk in the catamaran which has an opening hatch over the bunk.  He commented to me, that he could clearly see the stars as he lay there and we then we said good night.Shortly after this, he claims he was watching a large reddish, pulsating object progressing northward and wondered if it might be a satellite, but thought is was too big.  He claimed it to be as big as a silver dollar if held at arms length.About this time, the pulsating light took a sudden turn downward and made a figure S and then shot upward very, quickly upward and out of sight.

Since a number of highly credible sightings, which included photos during the summer of 1967, I am using the 1967 date but I can&apos;t actually remember the date other than I am positive it was summertime.Object was spherical, metallic-grey (gray), scratched or scuffed surface, perfectly stationary and seemed very close (&lt;500 ft). Vague memory of &quot;heat waves&quot; eminating around it but couldn&apos;t be mirage as it was well above the ground.  More like an optical distortion.  Appeared spherical due to sun shaping it as it would a ball. Hovered over golf course and was brought to our golfing party&apos;s attention by other golfers so there were more than 3 percipients.  Sky was very clear blue and the weather was sunny and warm and object was almost due West.  Gave up trying to make sense of it and teed off.

20100406,20100406," San Marcos, CA", oval,30 seconds,Out of this world looking craft !What we saw tonight was unlike anything we have ever seen before in our life. My mother was upstairs when she summoned me to come up and look at something. I went upstairs and she pointed out at the window. I was startled at what I saw. It looked like a huge craft with 5 or 6 bright lights in an oval shape and made out of individual boxes. It was hovering or moving very slowly to the West near Washingtonia Dr and Cocos lane in San Marcos. I knew instantly that this was something very strange indeed!  I ran downstairs to grab my camera and ran outside but it was gone. My mother said it left just a few seconds after I went downstairs.  I have seen a variety of craft but never anything like this. I&apos;m a pilot and know what conventional aircraft look like and this was nothing in any way conventional! It look like something completely out of this world and I so wish I could have snapped a picture of it or maybe someone in San Marcos or north San Diego county saw i! t too hopefully.,
20100406,20100406," Dublin, OH", triangle,3-5 minutes,"Up Close and Personal Triangle UFO sighting in Dublin, OhioFirst, let me state that until you actually see an ufo, you can definately be skeptical.  For those that have seen something spectacular, like what I&apos;m about to describe, it can be a particularly tedious burden.  Even your best friends and family that you trust with your life may struggle to comprehend and accept it.My Dad and I were standing by a lake behind our apartment in the suburbs of Columbus, Ohio.  I was about 25.  My Dad would have been about 48.  It was late, very late.  Clear night.  Dark.  But, even though it was about 2-3AM and dark, there&apos;s a glow from all the lights in the area, which almost makes the dark night a little luminescent...  it&apos;s a little easier to make out stuff against it&apos;s background.  Not as if what we were about to see was difficult to see.This wasn&apos;t just a distant group of lights.  This wasn&apos;t one of those sightings that could have been something else.  This was an extremely close-up, almost to the point of being scary sighting.It started as I was looking up at the beautiful night.  I said in total panic/excitement as it approached, &quot;DO YOU SEE THAT, DAD...  TELL ME YOU SEE THAT...&quot;! It was coming across the sky at a fairly slow rate of speed....  maybe about the same rate as a car on a backroad....  about 40mph.  Seemed slower, but I&apos;m guessing that 40 mph looks slower at about 1,500-2000ft.  The excitement was indescribable.  As it flew from the left(going west) it nearly crossed rt above us.  You could easily see the structure of the craft.  It was like a dark black against the lit up gray nt.  It was a perfect triangle with slightly rounders corners.  Just inside the outer rim in each corner, fitting perfectly, there were perfect circle lights.  Subtle lights as in an extremely soft white light bulb.  As it got closer the lights appeared to have movement, possibly circular, almost gasious in appearance.  There was NO sound as this object came to a halt nearly right above us.  Sat hovering still for about 20 seconds, pivoted on an axis about 90-100 degrees, and then flew away in a fashion that is very hard to describe and accept. After pivoting it sta! rted to move south at the earlier slow rate of speed, only this time, within seconds, it accelerated at an astronomical rate.  Going from right over our heads to out of sight in about 2 seconds...  the first second slowly moving... and then out of sight about 1 second later.This is when the harsh reality sets in.   We both went back inside the apartment(about 60yards away), and pondered what we should do.  Our hearts were still racing.  SHould we call the cops? No Way.  The Paper? No.  It didn&apos;t take long for us to realize that our sighting, as clearly defined and unquestionable as it was to us, would sound crazy.  I think i remembered reading something in the paper, maybe the day after, that talked about multiple sightings of a simliar craft around Bellfountaine, Ohio.This sighting was something that Dad and I both took extremely serious for a long time.  But, after years of realizing that our little secret was actually better kept that way, it still haunts us in such a profound way that it has literally changed both of our views of religion and science.  What we saw WAS NOT human.  It was NOT built by humans.  It was NOT being flown by humans.  Could NOT have been flown by humans.  Could NOT have been built by humans.  It was unquestionably a craft from another world.  This is information that we have shared less and less as time has passed since the event.   It has changed our very lives, but it&apos;s not something that we bring up very often.  I think we both regret not being able to talk about it more.   We both regret that more people didn&apos;t see what we saw.  I guess for some people there&apos;s sightings that could have been something else.  This sighting was nothing else.  It was exactly what we thought it was.  It will always be.  I should ! feel very priviledged.  Not many people see something like this that is so clear and undeniable.  So unlike how the event comes off when it&apos;s told to anyone else.  Everyone else wants to explain away what we saw - if only they had been there to see there was no explaining away this &apos;ifo&apos;.  That&apos;s the way i refer to it...   because I have identified it as something not of this world.My Dad was a minister of 30 years.  After the event, he stopped preaching and basically dropped religion altogether.  The event had a similiar effect on me as far as religion.  I just want to yell at the skeptics, but you can&apos;t.  If I had a clear tape of the event, and took it to the media, it would probably get dismissed away as &apos;such a great sighting that it couldn&apos;t be real&apos;.  And that&apos;s the sad reality of things when it comes to ufo sightings.  The media and the government have made it so taboo.  It&apos;s crazy.  You&apos;re literally deemed psychotic if you&apos;ve seen one.  We are two very normal people.  No mental health history in our family.  No reason to make up something like this.  I can only imagine that people that actually make up sightings suffer the same fate as people who actually see something out of this world - denial and rejection.   My Dad and I are about as down to earth as anybody.",
20100406,20100406," Oregon City, OR", other,6 minutes,"At 1:30am a very large craft approaches Portland, OR airport from the south and stops near Oregon City.On Saturday, 2nd August 2008, my wife and I drove from home in Idaho to Oregon City to visit with my sister and brother-in-law. My sister has a trailer for camping and when we go to visit, the trailer parked beside the house, becomes our bedroom.We went to bed and after a while I began having some sinus problems and got up to work on the problem. I decided it was time for some fresh air and stepped outside and was soon joined by my wife checking to see if I was ok. From the front door of the trailer we could see some stars but decided to move to the west end of the trailer where the view was better.Clear starry night, some light pollution since we were in a city, but because it was 1:30am all was quiet and the stars were plentiful. We saw an airplane off in the distance traveling northwest with the navigational strobe lights flashing and it soon ranged out of sight.Then we saw another airplane approaching from the south with headlights on as planes do for night landings, and the Portland airport was about 16 miles due north. At first I had a feeling that the airplane was not quite &quot;right&quot; but did not think too much about it. As we watched it approach closer to us from the south, I thought &quot;those landing lights are really bright.&quot; Indeed, single lights could not be seen but the whole front of the plane facing us was lit up with very intense beams. As the plane moved through the sky it was eclipsing stars--as it came between us and a star the star of course would vanish, it then reappeared as the plane moved on.Then it happened. The very bright lights of the plane, in two second steps, began fading. Fade, fade, fade...step at a time until no lights were on.  All this while, and this was most interesting, the plane slowed to a stop.  When we first saw it the plane was at about a 15&ordm; angle above level and now it was nearly 60&ordm; above level and very close.  I estimated it was a thick tapezoid hovering less than 4 miles away over the Willamette River.  Even though the bright lights were out, a faded outline could be seen for more than a minute.  Once the headlights were completely out, we saw that there were no navigation lights flashing.  The plane had mostly vanished from the sky, at least no bright lights to say it was there.  Also, no stars were being eclipsed in any direction from where it stopped and turned off the lights.  About a minute after the lights were completely out, there was a quick small flash, smaller than the outline area of the plane, and then it actually vanished.  Actually vanished because the starlight it blocked now shown through and no star eclipses were in any direction from that point.  If my guess on distance is accurate, then the craft would have been at least 200 feet across. Plane? I don&apos;t think so.",

I  am 45 years old, and saw this when I was approximately 10-11, so I&apos;d say it was in 1975. I havn&apos;t told anybody about it until a couple years ago as I thought nobody would believe me. I can see it as clearly in my head as I could when I saw it as a kid.It was a clear, bright sunny blue-sky day around high noon when I was walking home to my grandmothers&apos; from a cousin&apos;s house on one of the backroads of Noxen. No drugs, booze, glue-sniffing etc. I was a pretty clean and straight kid and had just spent the morning hanging out with my cousin.The road runs along the back side of town at the bottom of a mountain known as Schooley&apos;s Peak. The peak of the mountain is clearly visible from the section of road I was walking.Something caught my eye and I looked up at the top of Schooley&apos;s Peak and there was this large bright metallic silver cigar shaped smooth object hovering at an angle of approximately 20 degrees directly over the top of the mountain peak at an altitude I would guess to be about 50-75 feet from the top of the peak, just well over the treetops. It was large, and the length of the craft was a longer  than the hover altitude so I&apos;d say it was somewhere around 75-100 feet in length. There were small dark horizontal slits dead center of the object running the entire length. If I were to guess I&apos;d say there were about 15-25 of them.There was no sound, no lights, it was completely silent and just hanging over the mountain top. I observed it for about 10-15 seconds, I remember a feeling of fear setting in and I looked away for a moment, then looked up again and it was gone, just vanished silently and did not return.I don&apos;t remember anything else after that happened that day, I don&apos;t even remember the walk the rest of the way home, I&apos;m sure it was due to the overwhelming sight that I saw.I just found your website today and searched Noxen, PA. I was surprised to see there was another sighting there and decided to post my experience. It&apos;s a very small, backwoods town.

There was also a light right in the middle of all 3. There was a large distance between the lights, because at the speed they were moving, they stayed in perfect unison probably 5-6 miles apart from each other.I&apos;m not sure whether or not these were rim lights to some large craft, but it seems unlikely since the distance between them stayed in a perfect triangle. If this is the case, the craft must have been absolutely huge.The speed of this object was approximately (and I&apos;m guessing here) 10-15x faster than the airplanes I observed in the sky over the SF Bay Area during the minutes after the sighting. I can&apos;t stress enough that this thing was moving INCREDIBLY FAST!  The night sky during the event was very hazy, with the lights from San Francisco making it hard to see the stars.

I was accompanied by two friends  (A women in the back seat and a man in the front seat.We were just beginning to emerge from a hail storm when a very bright, white light came into view in the upper right of my windshield moving westerly at a very high rate of speed.  I knew immediately that it wasn&rsquo;t any kind of conventional aircraft.  As I looked at the light I asked my friend, &quot;What the hell is that?!&quot;  Looking at it, my friend replied, &quot;I don&rsquo;t know.&quot;  I am a private pilot and have logged more than a thousand hours in small single engine aircraft. The first thing I noticed was the lack of navigation lights on it. The light was less than 1500 feet above ground because it was flying lower than the clouds that produced the hail storm.  I estimated these clouds to be around fifteen hundred feet and the light to be about a thousand feet above ground level.  It was also less than half a mile to our right.  So it was very close when I first saw it.  I figure it was moving at several hundred miles per hour.  Probably around mach 1. Yet there was no noise.  The ball of light seemed to be the same size as a small single engine aircraft.  But it was so bright it is really hard to say with accuracy.It made a slightly ascending  ten degree right turn then turned back to the left about fifteen degrees and leveled off at about fifteen hundred feet above ground level.  In less than a minute, it was already quite a distance away, perhaps as much as ten or fifteen miles.  It seemed to slow down as it approached Aberdeen.  Since we were traveling in the same direction, it remained in sight for maybe as long as ten minutes as we moved toward Aberdeen.  It in fact seemed to be hovering over Aberdeen at one point.  But it is hard to tell from that distance whether it was over Aberdeen and whether it was still moving slowly or hovering.As we emerged from the hail storm the sky became partly cloudy and the stars came out.  Even being several miles away it was much brighter than the stars.  As we approached about five miles out of Aberdeen the light finally disappeared from view.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and he seemed to us to be an exceptionally competent witness.

But how could two people see the same thing not once but twice in one week.  Once with my friend and the other with my then girlfirend who thought I was crazy until she saw it her self.Me and my friend were at mellaluca lakes in port st lucie fl. at around 10:30 pm we looked toward our left ,(toward kennedy space center just north of st lucie) and we noticed something we thought was the shuttle lifting off at night, because of the orange glow coming from underneath as if it were a lift off. The strange thing is that it was acending very slow and straight up not at an angle like the shuttle does and as sure as I said that to my friend the light shot straigt up what looked to be at least 3 miles up in the blink of an eye I mean rediculously fast.Before I knew it the thing started coming our direction I had to be at least 5 miles away and was over the lake we were at within 2 to 3 seconds and when we saw it hover over the lake the whole sky reflected off of it ,it was about the size of a vw bettle and there were two lights on top long ones moving back and forth. It was very quiet no sound but the crickets and frogs man, dont know what it was but my bud s! tarted shaking and upon trying to start his car I asked him not to beacause I wanted to know if what we were seeing was real. Had him decribe what he was seeing and it was exactly what I was seeing so I know it was real.  I stepped out of the car and proceeded to walk toward the lake edge to get a closer look at it hovering( 50ft or so in air) as I opened the car door and stepped out it straighted it self out went side to side across whole lake which was at leat half mile wide, zig zagged about 7 time and shot straight toward palm beach county in the blink of an eye. Never believed in UFOs but have  since.  Saw it a week later after everyone said I was crazy. Standing out back my house was the second and last encounter. Looked over toward the lake ,( by this time my girl had already said she had enough and she didnt know if she believed me. About ten min later looking toward  the lake we both noticed a bright light which appeared to be a spot light on a small plane. Almost out! of my mind at this time because I thought I was going crazy f! or what me and my friend saw just days before. Anyway looked like a spot light on a small plane started to get brighter and brighter so I took my lighter and started flickering it just because I guess , but as I did it me and my girl noticed the spot light start to flicker as I did with my lighter. Kinda creepy my girl started to wonder at this time because the more I flickered my light the more the spot light did the same as it came our direction over the pine trees. As it got closer we heard what sounded like a prop plane single engine. At this time my girl pretty much called me crazy and said ,&quot;see it&apos;s just a plane man i agreed and said your right. All of a sudden the plane noise changed to a helicopter sound. My girl started to weird out about this time and wanted to go inside.I told her hell no please stay i said everyone thinks I crazy. She agreed and at this time the noise coming toward us change into distinctly what sounded like a jet engine noise,but the light coming towar! d us was moving slowly. Until right about 5 seconds later there it was no sound just quiet. No more plane sound no more helicopter sound no more jet sound just hovering over a 40ft pine in my back yard. It sat at an angle with this weird  feeling we were being watched. My girl started crying and I asked her what do you see? Her reply,&quot; I see it I beleive&quot;, and continued to cry. I told her to go in the house and get my mom and her husband and to quietly walk out the back door to see. She headed toward the house while I just looked in awe. I heard them come around the front of house instead of the back ,looked over to tell them to hurry, looked back up and saw it fade out of view in front of me and a little flickering light appeared and began moving so fast and in ways no plane we have could have moved with such precission and no sound. Unfortunately my mother and her husband did not see it as we did. I was still called a lier even after my girl told them what she had seen. N! ote we were not believers until these events occured.

I had woken up in the middle of the night and had a strange urge to look outside and that&apos;s when I saw it &quot;floating&quot; very slowly and very low overhead.  It was maybe a few stories above the rooftops of the hig! hest home.  It made absolutely no sound, and was a very dark matte finish (not shiny metallic), not reflective at all, with a very complex underside of infrastructure (i.e., it wasn&apos;t smooth underneath but had what appeared to be rectangular and other geometric shaped objects on it&apos;s underside protruding from underneath).  It had no lights anywhere on the craft, contrary to what a lot of reports seem to detail.  This had no lights whatsoever, and I doubt anyone would have seen it if they didn&apos;t look up because it blended so perfectly against the night sky and was completely devoid of any sound.  It slowly hovered away from my townhouse and then I saw it stop and start to move back to where my home was.  I always thought I&apos;d be the first person to run out to something like this and be proud to witness it, but to my surprise I was literally so afraid that I couldn&apos;t continue to look out my window and went hiding in fear.  I guess when something like this actually happens to y! ou, the perspective becomes one of instinctual survival.  I ha! d a stro ng sense that my observation of this had been detected and I felt very vulnerable and exposed for about 5 minutes and then the feeling of being watched just stopped.  That&apos;s when I looked out again and it was gone.  I wish I had had the courage to go outside and observe it more closely or get some photographs.  I have promised myself that no matter what, if this ever happens again, I will do whatever I can to get evidence of it regardless of how afraid I am.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

My wife and 21 year old son witnessed this very strange event while traveling Southbound on 5-S.  I am currently in Tucson,  AZ, as a retired U.S. Navy Chief (reason being that I retired June 1 of last year and due to our economy going down the tubes, I had no choice but to lose everything and begin traveling in search of my post naval career), but back on topic...my wife called me to report seeing 3 rather large (larger than anything Boeing has ever made) triangular shaped craft which was soon joined by a 4th craft.  Then the craft merged into one and began making some very interesting shapes in the sky (as you will see on the photos).  I immediately informed her to pull over as soon as she could and begin snapping pictures.Unfortunately by the time I got that message across (our first 2 attempts at connecting via cell phone were no good as we would lose signal), but by the time I got the message across sunset had already set in however, my wife used a Palm Treo 650 cell phone with its camera settings on maximum resolution to take the pictures (in which I have about 25 total).  The Palm returned some very interesting photos to say the least.  Upon receiving the pics I immediately reported the sighting to MUFON and filed a report:  Case Number:  22723.  At the end of the event they all seemed to merge into 1 or 2, dipped down from their hover and shot skyward at a very high rate of speed (in which one of them pulsed red as he/she ascended)   Later that evening I noticed that 2 or 3 other people in Southern California reported UFO activity.   One report identically mirrored what my wife and son saw (which indicated 4 craft merging into 2).   We are DEFINITELY not alone in this universe.Thank you. JC",

We watched, without blinking for about 25-30sec. until the craft traveled out of eyesight.What I saw was seven lights in a triangular formation traveling east at a very slow pace. As it moved away I caught a glimpse of what looked to be more than the V pattern itself, it was a dark circular shape around the lights.  It was HUGE!

Starting with my last sighting.On 02/24/2010.At 1330 while driving on Interstate 8 going west, we were about 30 miles out of Gila Bend, I was traveling with my fianc&eacute;,  I had told her on one occasion I had seen a UFO on this same stretch of road, back in 2002, It was a relatively clear sky , as I remarked that we were getting close to the location of my first sighting on this road, I told her that just north  in the foot hill&rsquo;s is where it was, so she looked and  remarked in a hushed voice, &ldquo; Yea I see it&rdquo;, and so I looked harder and there it was, a  bright white ball of light, it looked to be on the far side of the hill&rsquo;s to the north, 15-20 miles away. I was driving around 75 mph. It remained visible  out the side window  &ldquo;as if traveling in pace with us&rdquo; this could just be a trick of distance, but  it remained visible to us while we stopped in Yuma for a snack,  and on till we passed El Centro Ca.  It never changed its Altitude or distance, to any extent visible to us, but did remain out the passenger window till about 1600, and we were going into the foothills.The first time I had this happen on this road was 8 or 9 years ago in November, and I was going East, My first sight of it was around 10:00 the sun was on my right the object was North by North East I was just going into the curves that drop you out of the foothills, my guess at that time was it was 50 miles away, I watched it as I was traveling on my motorcycle, I stopped for gas 2 times and it remained steadily visible till I was almost to Phoenix, that sighting lasted for over 4 hours, it &ldquo;shrunk into the distance N.xNe.&rdquo;",

20100412,20100412," Terre Haute, IN", triangle,30 min,"Triangular object with about 3 lights that changed from bright white to all red when it slowed down.The incident occurred on 04-11-2010 in Terre Haute, IN.  It lasted for at least a half an hour between 9:45-10:30 pm EST.  My husband and I were on our way to return a movie rental and from there, to the gas station.  A few minutes earlier, I had tried to go to the gas station that was closest to home, but the lines were backed up and the attendant said the systems were down.  So, I came home and told my husband what was going on and that I&apos;d try later.  He said he wanted to make sure the tank was filled, so he decided to come along and after returning the movie, we would just go to the gas station that&apos;s a few miles down the street.  As we were leaving the parking lot of the video store, (driving west) I noticed a very bright white light, coming from the east just over the trees well north of us.  At first, I thought it was a low-flying plane but it seemed to be moving faster than a plane and it had no colored lights just very bright white.  I told my husba! nd, who was driving at the time, what I was seeing and he tried to get a look, but we were on a fairly busy street and the object was coming in and out of view from behind trees. He didn&apos;t want to cause an accident so, I just kept watching the object, waiting for it to reach an open area.  While I was watching it, the object went from a fast-moving white light to nearly a stop and all the bright white lights turned bright red.  It appeared to be hovering or moving very slowly in the north sky.  As I was telling my husband what had just happened, that I wasn&apos;t crazy, and I knew what I had seen...we turned south.  It was then behind us and out of view.  While driving maybe 3 city blocks south, I noticed the red lights again, this time, in an open area in the distant southwestern sky.  It must&apos;ve moved really fast toward the south (without us noticing) in order for it to be that far ahead of us that soon.   Finally, my husband saw it too.  When we reached the gas station (the ! one that&apos;s a few miles from home) I went inside to pre-pay and! the att endant said the system had just went down.  My husband stayed outside watching the object that appeared to be hovering or moving really slow still to the south of us.  We pulled out from the gas station (driving east) and the object appeared to be moving again slowly toward the northeast.   It looked like it was going to pass directly overhead and we were in an area where we could pull off the road into a vacant lot.  My husband got out of the car, looked up, and watched it slowly pass over us.   He described it as a triangular object with distinct bright red lights at the corners and 1 white light, that made only a slight humming sound.  I couldn&apos;t hear anything from inside the car.  I would think any plane flying that low and that slow would be much louder than a slight hum, but I could be wrong.  I had my cell phone on me but didn&apos;t think to take a picture because, at that time, we were just trying to figure out what it was.  It seemed to be heading northeast toward the s! ame area where I had initially seen it.  We pulled out of the lot and headed north again to the gas station nearest home to see if their systems were up yet.  The object remained on the west side of us moving north toward the east.  We watched it the entire time we were driving, and this time, I tried to take a picture of it with my cell phone.  The street lights and the treetops that were near the object were visible on my screen but, the red lights were not showing for me to get a picture.  It was like my camera couldn&apos;t pick it up.  We pulled up to the gas station (nearest our home) and I went inside to ask if the system was working yet.  The attendant told me it was working fine now... so, I pre-paid.  I went outside to pump the gas and the pump said OUT OF SERVICE.  The attendant came over the intercom and said &quot;I&apos;m sorry, it&apos;ll be a few minutes the system just went down again.&quot;  The object continued on it&apos;s way to the northeast until it was out of view. It was then, t! hat conveniently, the system came back up and I was finally ab! le to fi ll up my tank.  I never saw it return to the bright white lights that I had initially seen, it remained red until it disappeared from view.  I don&apos;t know how to explain the systems going down whenever that thing was in the vicinity, or how I couldn&apos;t pick up the lights on my camera.  I don&apos;t know if anyone else noticed this or reported it.  It happened right over town and there were many people out and about.  Maybe it was just a plane and the systems failing was all just a coincidence...I don&apos;t know.  All I do know, is it was a &quot;weird&quot; and rather frustrating experience for us.  I would also like to know if anyone else experienced this.",

My window faced the east.  I knew where each star should be.On the night I saw the object,  I saw a bright light above the trees located across a pasture in front of my house.  I knew it was not supposed to be there according to the time on the clock.  I continued to watch the bright light to see if it might be a helicopter or something like that.  The object did not move.I continued to watch the object for almost two hours.  All the other bright lights (stars and etc.) moved upward, but this light did not.  It stayed in the same position.Without any warning, the light started to move ever so slowly in a southerly direction. It continued to move very slowly and then all of a sudden it moved faster and faster and then it zoomed out of site, like a streak across the night sky and was gone.I awoke my father and told him. We went outside to look, but it was gone.  Thank goodness he believed me.That incident made me a believer in life off of earth.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",

They colors were green, red, blue, white, and maybe a few others. I knew it was not an airplane as it&apos;s flight pattern was not as our planes could do. It would raise altitudes and go from side to side at such great speeds our planes wouldn&apos;t stay intact.  I only got one quick glance at the actual object when it light up brightly one time and it was in a oval shape.

I looked up from my driveway to see what I first thought was a night bird, but as my eyes followed it, I could see it was a horizontal triangle with three lights.  Because the night sky was filled with stars, I could see the shape of the object as it blocked the stars&rsquo; light.  The triangle appeared to be about 200 feet up, moving easterly in an almost-straight line, wobbling slightly, not always quite level.  It moved at the pace of a soaring bird, coasting through the air.  It seemed to be about five feet wide.  Three round lights were evenly spaced in its corners, the same color as the stars, pale bluish-white, with indistinct edges.  The triangle itself appeared to be grayish, though that may be only because it was against the dark sky.  I noticed in particular that it made no sound.",

Ironically the Warwick Mall was just flooded by a bunch of rainy weather that just happened in RI so the whole thing is damaged and closed down.

There was high visibility--light cirrus clouds near the horizon, low-lying but nothing but blue sky above 10,000 feet.  I looked up and saw what I thought was a star.  This took place around lunch-time, between 11:30 and 12:30 roundabouts.  The star was very bright and I thought it was strange because I couldn&rsquo;t see any other stars.  Then it started to move, very, very slowly west to northeast over the course of the next 7 minutes.I tried not to take my eyes off of it because it was small and clearly above 30,000 feet as I could see some 747s making contrails (short trails due to such clear conditions) below and around the &ldquo;star&rdquo;.  It was not using any of the sky-lanes that planes normally use.Occasionally, maybe three minutes in, and then at the five or six-minute mark, it would stop totally for 30 seconds.  It also seemed to have a perfect circlular aura that almost pulsed outwards, only faintly discernible from the object and the blue sky around it.  I was wearing a good pair of sunglasses with polarization so the sky was very blue and the star quite bright against it.  When I took the glasses off the star was still visible but difficult to track.The bizarre thing is that my eyes went right to it, and there was 360 degrees of clear blue sky.  If I hadn&rsquo;t immediately seen it or known it was there, I could have missed it.  Would have missed it.It was very bright.  Again, I thought it was a star.  That high up, that shape, that type of light.  The weather was perfect &ndash; spring time and about 72 degrees.  I wanted to shout to the neighbors to ask &ldquo;what is that&rdquo;, but for those 7 minutes the neighborhood was a ghost town.I didn&rsquo;t take a picture because my phone was inside the house and I knew if I took my eyes off of it I might lose it.

Also, because of the fact the light just went on then all of a sudden went off-not out of sight although we couldn&apos;t see it anymore-I do not think it was anything man made.I have never been on a UFO site before nor have I have had a sighting.

I was able to watch it for about 10 seconds give or take as it fell, and noticed the apparent size of the object from my distance meant it could not have been terribly far away---my best guess being it fell somewhere beyond campus in the fields beyond.  I should note that this was at night of course, and my sense of distance could have been skewed, but that object was pretty bright and appeared large from my viewpoint.My first impression was it could have been a lone stray firework, but as I studied it, my impression was that of a fireball.  As the object fell, I saw the clouds off in the distance reflect the red light as the red/green &quot;fireball&quot; fell past them.  The only other thing I noticed as I observed it was my best guess at its distance from me, as stated above.After it fell beyond where I could see, I thought about it and decided it was interesting, but probably nothing.

It is my belief that what was seen was a helicopter.  My reasoning for this is based on the fact that many RI National Guard Blackhawk helicopters were in the air at that time because it was a disaster area and FIMA was involved as well as other state and federal agencies. The choppers were probably doing security flights as there was some looting going on in the disaster areas.  I am not a debunker. I have filed two sightings with you in the past few years and I believe in what MUFON is attempting to do.  I read a lot of the monthly reports with great anticipation.

Lake Mead Recreation Area  About 8-10 miles East of Hollywood Blvd on Lake Mead Blvd.  United Airlines/US Air 757,767, or Airbus, with Blue underside (body and engines), had departed McCarran IAP (3:15) Aprox. time 270 (west) making slow climbing 180 turn to 90 (east).I have been observing similar lights over the last two years in this area.  The lights have the ability to emulate small aircraft navigation/strobe lights (green/white and red).  When they are no longer visable from cockpit crews the lights return to their normal blury red/white strobe pattern.  I have never observed these lights mess with any commercial or conventional aircraft.The commercial flight is climbing out of Aprox. 17,500 AGL 90 degree heading East over Lake Mead and Est. airspeed at 275-325 knots.  The four lights are 1000-1500 feet apart two lead center with wing men trailing outside and Aprox. 500 AGL over Lake Mead.  The four lights have returned to red/white light pattern as the commercial flight passed overhead.  The Pilot/First officer probably requested a verification from Nellis AFB if they were painting any other aircraft in the area.  Whatever the communication, the four lights went from their position and elevation to the commercial flights elevation/airspeed/position in Aprox. 3-5 seconds and climbed out with them.  One lead light 500 meters off Captain&apos;s left window, second lead light 1000 meters off Co-pilots right window with the wing men lights 1000 meters from leaders and off commercial flights wing tips.  Whatever the circumstance it would be safe to say these two pilots probably needed to change their shorts.  This happened between 3:30-3:40 AM.

PDT on April 15th, 2010 in Ventura California.I was looking toward the west at the constellation of Orion when I heard a brief &quot;screech&quot; sound lasting around one second and coming from the vicinity which I was viewing. Thinking it was an owl I quickly looked for it and saw a faint silhouette of something moving in the clear sky.  At first it looked like it was a large bird high in the air as the front and two sides were heavily darkened against the mostly dark sky.  It was moving toward me and over a period of about 2 seconds it became clearer and resembled a hang-glider. It was descending and moving toward the east and seemed to be gliding smoothly, making no sound that I could hear.   As it reached its closest point to me, what looked to be several hundred feet or so, a very sharp and definite outline appeared.  It was an equilateral triangle and had three circular areas symmetrically placed near the tips. There was a slight contrast between the gray triangular area and the circular areas, as the circular portions ! had a very faint glowing quality to them.  As it silently continued moving away from me, the craft seemed to have only 2 dimensions.  It looked completely flat like it was a projection.  It began to gently ripple with smooth wave patterns and disappeared within a little over a second after doing so. The total event lasted around 8 seconds.I have my master&rsquo;s degree in physics and teach college level physics as a career.  I am also involved in astronomy.  I am about 20 minutes drive from a naval base and do hear and see military aircraft from time to time. Though it is possible that I was seeing a &quot;secret aircraft,&quot;  I am doubtful that such a craft would be flown in such plain view as it was very apparent what was seen.  Judging from the change in angular diameter, its descent was fairly rapid and it changed from a dark, fluctuating shadow into a crisp configuration, lightly contrasted against the clear dark sky.  I would estimate the base of the triangle to be around 50 feet, though I could be way off.   Once leveled off at around 500 feet, it glided forward at perhaps 100 miles per hour until it disappeared from sight somewhat like a mirage does. The measured angle from the horizontal at which the craft began to wave out of sight was around 20 degrees.  It all happened very fast and was short in duration, m! aking it difficult to be definite on measurements.  All in all, I saw a craft without doubt and I am perplexed by what I have seen.",

There is no base around Wenatchee so we rarely see military aircraft.  When I looked out the window I saw a the wavy distortion that you would expect from something extremely hot. Like a hot road distorting the scenery on the horizon.  But I saw no lights or planes in the darkness. I laid back down and stared up at the stars through my skylight, which is apprx. 8&apos; x 8&apos; in size. Around 10 min. later, I saw a classic black triangle floating silently above my house.  Perfectly framed in my skylight as if planned. I could see it blacking out the stars behind it more than I could actually see the craft, but it was a definite triangle.  Moving quite slowly. Nobody I have asked, around town, saw it. My girlfriend woke up to the jet sounds but nobody else seems to have heard it.  Which I find hard to believe because it was insanely loud.There was also a little spot plane circling the area of my house for about 30 min before the sighting and an hour after, which is very strange.  I never see or hear planes circling that late. And I live by a small airport.That&apos;s about it, really.  I have seen several ufos over the years but never the infamous triangle!

If you held a quarter in your finger tips and put your arm out that is how big the object was as seen by us . It was blocking out some of the stars as it flew through the sky . It was so close that we were able to perfectly see the triangular shape with three large round lights as bright as the stars in the sky and about the same size . The lights were perfectly spaced apart from eachother at each point of the triangle . I could make out a faint shape of the craft and it was a differant shade of dark than the sky . About 5 minutes later after the sighting there was a jet flying roughly in the same direction almost as if tracking or monitoring the object . The jet i could hear clear as day and it was up much higher than this object . I called the local airport here and i was told that the tower shuts down at 10 pm and that there shouldnt have been any flights or activity at that time wich leads me to believe it was a military jet . But that isnt all that had happend , about 10 minutes prior to this UFO we had seen two differant stars that had been moving at high rates of speed and every few seconds they would pulse and then nothing .

It flew at a steady pace. Id say the speed was equivalent ! to seeing a low flying Cessna it was fast, but not supersonic.

But it was odd because it was mostly cloudy out that night so i just kept watching the object as i was driving.  It kept coming closer to the ground so i thought maybe a meteor had came into the atmosphere because it was glowing a yellow-orange color and you could see a trail of light behind it as well.  Then, for a moment i passed some near by trees and houses so i lost sight of it for a couple of seconds.  After i regained sight of it however it was no longer a bright light in the sky. i could only see the side at this point and it looked like some small aircraft maybe the height of a helicopter.  But i knew it wasn&apos;t a helicopter after it passed the road down maybe half a mile away from where i was still driving.  I could see the back of it after it crossed and at that point i saw the object had no wings and i could hear nothing coming from the object.  And these little dim lights completely went around the circumference of it and on the back, there were two bright lights in the shape of a square that little up for only a brief second.

One at a time in a space of 2 hours or so.I am a student of history attending the University of Iceland.  I&rsquo;d like to note that I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like this before.  I do believe it is possible that aliens may have visited us and that UFOs might be alien spacecraft.  The things I witnessed yesterday night left a lasting impression on me and I&rsquo;m actually filing this report because I just need to get this sighting of my chest.Last night me and my girlfriend had just finished watching a movie. The time was roughly 2:45 am.  I walk out onto my deck and light cigarette. As I am smoking the cigarette I notice a light descending across the sky.  My first thought is; &ldquo;Oh cool, a shooting star&rdquo;. But the object moved far too slow for any shooting stars that I&rsquo;ve ever seen and it&rsquo;s descent was taking much longer then any shooting star I&rsquo;ve observed.  As I&rsquo;ve been looking at it for maybe 5 seconds it suddenly starts to ascend in a curve and then suddenly it makes a U-turn in the sky and bolts at high velocity in the opposite direction it was originally travelling.  By the time this happens I&rsquo;ve called my girlfriend to come look.  Then the object vanishes but reappears a short distance away from it&rsquo;s vanishing position about 2 seconds later, takes off at high speed again and then vanishes again. By this time my girlfriend is outside with me but missed seeing the object.About 30-40 minutes later I went back outside both to see if I could see some more of these things and to have a cigarette. After gazing at the sky for 2 minutes or so I noticed another light. This light moved in a straight line but seemed to be changing speeds as it did. I observed 5 lights like these in a 15-20 minute timeframe and they all moved in the same line but I never saw more then one at a time. I lost sight of the lights as they moved over my apartment building. They must have been very high up. I called my girlfriend to see these and she saw two of them and agreed with me that there was something strange about those lights. As it was really cold outside I went back inside.As I was about to go to sleep at about 4:40 am or so I went outside again to have a cigarette before bed. It was beginning to light up a bit outside but still semi-dark. I then observed about 5-6 lights appear one at a time far away on the horizon. They seemed to appear out of nowhere and then they would bolt away at high speed and vanish. One of the lights actually took a whirl in the air before bolting away. Then I went to sleep.I would like to note that the sky that night was mostly cloud free and it was very starbright. Also I would like to note that due to a volcano that is erupting about 200-300 kilometers away from here there was very little airtraffic due to the ash, although none of the ash has reached Reykjavik yet a lot of European flights to Iceland have been cancelled in the last few days. Maybe that UFO was observing the volcano and used the chance as there were no other aircraft around, but that&rsquo;s just speculations.",

I am including her contact phone number in the appropiate section.Alien Encounter - Alien Encountered in Cheatham County, TN  I reside in Cheatham County, Tennessee, and observed an alien in my yard in February this year.The reason I am coming forward is because the description the woman in Georgia provided of the 3 alien beings she observed at a campsite where she and her husband were camping the latter part of 2009 is almost exactly the same as what I saw.It was approximately 5:00 in the morning.  There was still snow on the ground from the last snow.  I had gotten ready for work and was sitting in my Suzuki in the drive letting it warm up before leaving for my job in Nashville, Tennessee.I caught movement out of the corner of my eye in the area of my garage (which is used for storage and not to pull a car into).  At first, I thought it was one of the neighbor&apos;s dogs.I turned to look and saw something which very closely matched the description of the alien creatures which the woman in Georgia observed.Its body, extra long arms and hind legs were so thin.  Its head was very large and bumpy.It was pale in color and hairless.It was very cold outside, and the creature appeared a light grayish color (I&apos;m not sure whether the cold temperature would have affected the appearance of the color).The only difference in my story and hers is that the 3 creatures she saw were upright.  This was moving on all 4&apos;s, however, the way it was moving made it appear like a monkey or gorilla that are oftentimes upright, but then use their arms in conjunction with their legs to propel themselves forward.On all 4&apos;s, it was about the height of a large dog, and I observed that it would be considered short, compared to most humans, if it stood upright.Its legs were short, quite a bit stockier than the body and arms, which were long and skinny.It kept looking back as though it thought it was being followed, and so it was surprised to see me sitting inside the automobile when it looked around, directly at me, for the first time.I got a good look at its large, round eyes which were darkish in color.  They appeared a dark brown.  It was as though it sensed I wasn&apos;t going to hurt it, and it continued on across my yard, across the road, and continued out a connecting road which is directly in front of my home.There are lots of wooded areas in the direction it was traveling, and lots of wooded area behind my home.I am not comfortable just ignoring this occurrence. Questions are racing through my mind - questions which need to be answered.What are these creatures doing in our wooded areas, hiding out by day and wandering by night?  Where did they come from?  Are they depleting any of our resources?  Will they become dangerous if someone acts aggressively toward them?  (I was so busy looking at its eyes and bumpy head that I cannot describe a nose and/or mouth.)  I am a sane individual who is employed at one of Nashville&apos;s most prominent law firms.((NUFORC Note:  Witness, and source of report, indicate that date is approximate.

To my left, I saw what looked like a huge plane flying way too low.  I thought it was going to crash with it being so low, so I started to slow down.  The closer I got to it, I saw that it was a military cargo plane.  Then, it seemed like it was not moving...so I stopped almost completely when I got right beside it. t was not moving.  I turned down my radio and there was no noise from the plane.  It looked like a big military cargo plane, it couldn&apos;t have been any higher in the air than the top of a telephone pole.  I could read the stickers on it it was so low.  All I remember of the stickers is that there was an American flag and numbers and letters, no words.  The plane was not tipping in any direction.  It was completely still.  Just sitting in the air.  After about a minute of being right beside it, traffic started coming from the other direction so I had to move.  Once the t! raffic moved, I could not see it anywhere behind me.  There was no plane and no smoke from a crash.  It was just gone. I had the worst feeling of a panic attack I have ever felt.  It started just as soon as I looked over at the plane when it was beside me.  My entire chest hurt and I felt like I was going to vomit.  I was so afraid.  And, I do not know why!",

My computer was badly corrupted.  I hope you can still accept this message from me.I want to comment on the Casselberry Florida sightings if I may.  I myself, my husband, my mother, and my Niece were at Dog Track Road and Hwy 17-92 at the red light about 11:00 sometime in the middle 1980&apos;s and we saw something very strange.  I myself heard a low hum and I said what is that sound?  My family and I looked up out from our windows and saw what appeard to us as a huge low hovering object that seemed to be the size of the car lot that was at the light.  I remember saying that looks like something off of Battlestar Galactica.  We all saw it.  It also seemed to have different colored  rectangle shpaes on the bottom of it which was the part we were looking up at from our car to the best of my memory.  Some of the rectangles were smaller than others.  I think I remember a Purple color.However, we have told ourselves over the years it was something we have made to much out of so it has been disregaurded, but has always been a memory that I would like to know if anyone else has ever seen anything like it before.  I saw the comments by someone on this sight that lives near a dog track in Casselberry, and I&apos;m thinking it must be the Old Dog Track on Dog Track road in Casselberry.  The placement of their sightings and sounds near the palce we saw strange things has prompted me to e-mail this.I will make one last comment, I do remember being kind of scared and my husband said lets get out and see it closer and I remember saying, &quot;No, way!&quot;  I&apos;m not getting out of this car.  We drove on throug the intersection when it was our turn to go and it appeard to be done.

We were on the thruway and saw what looked like two very bright white lights with a flashing red one between them.  I thought nothing of it thinking it was a radio tower.  We approached the Angola rest stop and the lights appeared to not be attached to anything but just hovering.  We passed the Angola rest stop and actually drove past it (the craft).  It appeared to be about 10 stories off the ground.  We saw the underbelly of the craft and it was triangle shaped.  It had three bright lights on each corner of the triangle and there were two bright white lights on its belly, one longer than the other, there was a red flashing light between those lights.  As we passed it (at about 10:12 PM), I continued to look back and the craft&rsquo;s front light looked like a spotlight- it had a light cone.  It rotated and then disappeared in place.  It didn&rsquo;t fly away, it faded away.  Like it went into the clouds, but! there weren&rsquo;t any clouds that night.As we continued to drive, I saw what I can only describe as was a flashing red and blue star in the distance. It jumped a measured distance across the sky in bursts.  It was very fast. As we approached the Fredonia Exit we saw the flashing lights move closer.  Suddenly very close.  It didn&rsquo;t have its lights on anymore but it did have blue and red flashing tail lights. The underbelly of the craft looked indescribable.

Then they would cross each other. I got home and looked at object with a pair of binoculars. There were three at this time. Only one came close enough for me to get a good look (about 8 seconds) I could clearly see that the closest object was a very bright silver triangle (could be from the bright sun reflection) the objects left short contrails that were shaped like a snakes tongue. These objects would perform criss cross maneuvers and sudden upward and downward arcs. I watched as a third object began to sort of dogfight with the two others. This was very high in the sky. Way above normal air traffic. After about another 5 minutes they disappeared out of site heading towards Molokai. I took about 10 photos. None are ve! ry good I only can see the contrails. The maneuvers did not seem out of this world. I was watching because they looked to be possibly, my first thought, cloud seeding because of the patterns.

20100420,20100420," Erin, TN", rectangle,about 4 minutes,"Orange multi-colored rectangular craft seen heading north around 4pm on 4/18/10 in the Houston/Montgomery counties area of middle TN.My family and I were traveling East on Hwy 13 from Erin towards Clarksville on Sunday April 18, 2010 around 3:45 pm.  Directly ahead of us, (guessing over Cumberland Heights area was where it was) my husband and I both watched as this oddly shaped tangerine/peach colored rectangle passed in front of our field of vision going in a northerly direction.I say oddly shaped because the leading edge had well defined 90 degree edges on it and the length was consistent with a rectangle, but the back end was less well defined almost as if it was fading or in a mist at the back end.  The colors were very pretty and bright, and kind of rippled with different shades of orange, tangerine, peach, and even a little pinkish or salmon color.We were far enough away to see it in its entirety, and we saw no other aircraft around (at first I thought it might be a banner pulled behind a plane, but the sky was otherwise empty).  My husband suggested it was a blimp, but the shape was wrong, as was the area, for the area is very rural.We watched it as we continued our drive into town for about 4 minutes and my husband even sped up to get closer to it so that we could see it in more detail.  The closer we got, the more vivid the colors were.  We were also able to say without doubt that it was not being powered by or pulled behind any other craft in the sky.  We were trying to get close enough to see if it had any marking or writing on it, but as soon as we got close enough, the road went between two tree covered hills and we lost sight.  I would say that when we lost sight of the craft we were approximately 200 yards away and the craft was flying about 150 feet high, just over the tops of the trees on the hills that surround the road.  It didn&apos;t leave any con-trail, unless the &apos;mistiness&apos; of the back end would qualify, and it didn&apos;t seem to make any noise, but our distance from the craft and the fact we were in a moving vehicle could have been the reason we heard nothing.As we came out of the hills, my children (age 11 and 14) and I scoured the sky behind us and to the north for the rest of the drive in, but didn&apos;t see it again.  We figured it had to have landed somewhere in the woods, because it was just gone. We talked about it and we were all left scratching our heads.  To my total consternation, we had left the camera at home, and our cell doesn&apos;t have a camera, so we were unable to get a picture of it.We do live near an army base, and there are army aircraft of all sorts in the sky over us on a regular basis.  This sighting also took place not far from a TVA power plant off the Cumberland River.  I am unsure if this has anything to do with the sighting, but not far from the sighting is a small back country looking road that has been closed and gated with a sign saying something to the effect - closed by order of the U.S Government.  Could they all be related??  I am reporting this in the hopes that someone else saw what we saw and can verify or disprove to us what it was we saw.  My true hope is that someone else was able to get a picture or video of this UFO so that I don&apos;t wonder for the rest of my days what it was that we saw.Thank you for providing this forum so that can happen.",

It had lights pulsating in sequence beginning from the point of the triangle (the front) down to the back and then back up to the front.

I followed the object for a total of about 10 minutes, and was able to get a pretty good look of it.  The lights on it where a light blue in color.  The bottom/belly of the object appeared to be rounded. The object appeared to be a midnight blue in color but that could have been a reflection from the flashing blue lights.  For about 5 minutes the object was going with traffic while zigzagging left and right over the freeway.  After a little bit, still traveling in a zigzag path, it began to speed up until it traveled out of sight.  At 9 pm my boyfriend called me.  While explaining to him what I had seen,  I saw another light.  At that point I was coming up to the agricultural check point on the northbound side of I-5.  At first I thought it was an airplane.  When I got closer I realized it wasn&rsquo;t moving and it was only about 100 yards above the freeway.

There was no sound.They finally got a camera (evidently a small one and took a short video) I viewed the video on Youtube and it is not very good.He did say that his daughter then took a still photo with the flash on and that one of the objects flashed back.My brother, has lived in this house, near the airport, since his birth and stated that these were not any aircraft he had seen before, except for a similar sighting a year or two ago.He did call some of the local news stations.If you want to talk to my brother or one of the other witnesses, please email me, and I will forward your request.Video Link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVVnAJG9_kA&amp;feature=player_embedded",

However when viewed through a telescope it appears to have shape and remains solid in position.  Object does change colors but I can&rsquo;t determine if it&rsquo;s actual color change or just atmospheric light distortion.  The only reason the object caught my attention is the abrupt entry and exit speeds of the object.  I have clearly seen aircraft around the object by the indicator lights on the aircraft, but the aircraft&rsquo;s were not pursuing the object.  Unfortunately I&rsquo;ve tried both camera and video camera to capture the object but all I capture is a big blurry ball.  I&rsquo;ve tried to take a picture through the telescope but this also was a failure.  I cannot determine the entry and exit speeds however it does leave a trail of light through the sky which only lasts briefly.  It&rsquo;s entry and exit patterns very day by day.  Too dark to get a genuine shape however occasionally I will get a glimpse of a reflective surface on moonlit nights.  There is no noise that I can hear from this distance and other people have seen it but think it&rsquo;s an optical illusion and I believe it could be an optical illusion myself however it might be worth checking out.",

It appeared to be hovering just a few feet off the ground, round and disk like in shape with many windows.  It was close enough you could see activity in the port holes of the craft.My sense was that the being in the tree was lost or perhaps like a teenager took off and the mother ship was there to pick him/her up.

It was like the being and I had something in common, assuring me that there are struggles no matter who you are or where you are in the universe.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

However, if you turn your theater home speakers up and turn up the bass something strange happens.  You  hear this heavy strong engine bursting sound going off and on as if something is cruising through space.  As the night turns to day you see the green &quot;round&quot; fire ball appear and then the sound goes quiet until you hear an explosion and the object darts off into the horizon with no trails.  The strange part is that upon turning the sound up the volume gets caught or stuck and if you pause the film you will continue to hear it unless you close the file and re-open.  Final note is that as the object darts of or at the end of the footage you will hear the police radio pick up something.

20100423,20100423," Westwood, NJ", other,30 seconds,"Pyramidal Craft over Westwood NJUFO Sighting-  Point of view from me and my mother inside the car and also looking outside the car(with the window rolled down.)  My mother was driving me to a doctor&rsquo;s appointment at around 3:40pm through Westwood, NJ, facing west towards route 17.  My mother recalls exactly what I did when we reflected on this sighting.  I looked in the sky and saw a seemingly pyramidal shaped object.  It seemed metallic in nature; my mother describes it as a shiny aluminum.  It was dark, almost black at one face and extremely shiny at another face.   Also, there was some rotation that I observed on this object.   The most amazing thing about this object was its seemingly random and very rapid movement.Overall, this object was hovering over the town of Westwood, at one point right over our heads.  But in the objects vicinity, there was rapid movement.  At first thinking this was maybe an eye floater, since I was also inside the car, I opened the window and there it still was, moving very rapidly, yet in a general direction; It seemed as if it was headed somewhere.  The best analogy I can give for the rapid movement in the vicinity of the object is that of the following situation:  If you have a camera that you are holding and trying to focus on an object from far away, no matter how still you try to make your camera, the object always seems to be shaking.  This is what it looked it, like it was excessively shaking, even thrashing about.I have perfect vision and no history of mental problems.  My mother also claims to have witnessed this same phenomenon.  However, my mother was driving, and I actually took the time to open the window and capture the image in my mind, it is still very clear and fresh to me.   I also want to add that this was completely broad daylight on a clear blue sky with very few clouds.My mother and I would like to add that there must have been some other people who saw this object since it was in plain sight.Underneath I have drawn a picture of what it looked like. (This object would be against a clear blue sky).Again, it was trashing about spontaneously, not just traveling in a linear way.Also: I called the local paper, the Bergen Record.  They say that they received NO CALLS about this.I also called the Westwood Police station and told them about this, they said that they did not receive any calls regarding this phenomenon.    The officer from Westwood Police Department informed me to call Teterboro Airport to ask if there was anything in the air that day.  I asked for the number to call the airport; he could not find the number and instead told me that he would call Air Traffic Control (he said that if they needed to talk to me that they would call my house phone).  I haven&rsquo;t received a call yet, and if I do, I will update this.Personally, I am AMAZED that in this broad daylight, NO ONE OTHER THAN ME called the the police or news organizations&hellip;it might happen later but to the people who read this:  I GREATELY underestimated the TIMIDNESS and PASSIVENESS of people in general.  To me and my mom, we thought that MASSIVE amounts of people would report this&hellip;but in fact no one else did.PS: I tried sketching a picture but it wouldn&apos;t let me copy and paste it into the box.I would be happy to draw a picture.",
20100424,20100424," Norcoss, GA", other,30 Seconds,"Black &quot;boomerang&quot; over Norcross, GA during thunderstorm.On April 24, 2010, in Norcross, GA, at approximately 12:40 PM EST, I stepped outside my office to watch the start of a thunderstorm.  To the northwest, I observed a fairly large, black object in the sky above the trees but below the cloud ceiling (3600 feet, according to my local FAA Fight Service Station&rsquo;s data).  At first, I thought it was a hawk, as they do sometimes circle above.  But as it slowly moved across the sky, it became clear to me that it was, in fact, a solid boomerang or backwards-L-shaped object.  It had no lights and was silent (at least to my ears), and it didn&rsquo;t move like one would expect a gliding bird to.  As I reported above, this was during a thunderstorm, so with the cloud cover, there was no sun or anything else I could use to give it scale, but it appeared to me to be at least as large as a helicopter or a single-engine plane.  It was a solid, hard object, moving slowly and deliberately.It moved in a wide, horizontal arc towards me, traveling from left to right in my field of vision, and began moving to the north/northwest, away from my location, and disappeared, possibly into cloud cover.  One unusual aspect of this object was that the &quot;boomerang&quot; did not have a horizontal attitude like a plane, but rather a vertical one, hence the backwards &quot;L&quot; description.In the interest of accuracy and full disclosure, I should note here that I am mildly nearsighted and wear glasses for driving.  I was not wearing my glasses at the time of this sighting, and felt that there wasn&rsquo;t time to go and get them.  However, my vision isn&rsquo;t that bad, and I stand by what I&rsquo;ve described.So, I immediately wrote down the details of my observation, and went to my computer to look up what to do in the event of a sighting of this type, and then called the local police who, in turn, sent two officers to speak to me right away.  They listened to me but did not take a police report, and instructed me to keep a camera handy should the object reappear.  I then called the Center for UFO Studies to make a report.I should also put on record with this report that I&rsquo;ve had a mild interest in the subject of UFO&rsquo;s and have read about them and kept an open mind.  However, I never expected to have my own sighting, and can draw no conclusions as to what it really was that I saw, except that it didn&rsquo;t appear to me to be a plane, helicopter, or other known aerial vehicle.  It did not appear to be natural phenomena, but it did appear to be an object of some kind.",
20100424,20100424," Stillwater, MN", sphere,30 minutes,"A strange glowing / pulsating colored light was observed in the skys along with a jet that seemed to intercept itOn April 23, 2010 at approximately 1:45 AM my wife and I watched a strange light in the sky for approximately 30 minutes before it slowly disappeared. &nbsp;I was working overnight in the office downstairs when my wife called me upstairs to take a look at strange light that appeared across a nature preserve that we live on behind our house. &nbsp;It was a glowing, pulsating light that randomly changed colors (red, green, orange, blue) without following any particular pattern.  Every so often we could make out a white jolt of light that seemed to project out from the object in random directions (quickly like lightning).  The object was brighter than anything else in the sky and mostly hovered in one spot but also moved from side to side. &nbsp;At first, the light / object was large and did not seem to be very far away and I was almost sure that it was a strange type of lit up helicopter searching for something on the ground.  I opened the window expecting to hear the engine! and was very surprised to find that it was dead silent outside. &nbsp;  I worked as a professional photographer for a few years and have all pro level equipment.  I asked my wife to grab my camera (a Canon 5D digital SLR with 70-200 L 2.8 IS lens), tripod, and shutter release cable while I kept my eye on the light.  I wanted to try to get a long exposure that showed the path of the light over time.  Just as I got everything setup and settings dialed in, my newly charged batteries went completely dead. &nbsp;I asked my wife to try to find some other batteries while I kept my eye on the light.  As time went on, the light seemed to be dissipating and was getting smaller as if it was traveling away from us. I was also scanning the sky for anything else out of the ordinary and saw a high flying jet moving overhead.  The jet turned slightly and headed DIRECTLY toward the light. &nbsp;We were watching as the jet approached.  My wife returned with new batteries and I took a 30 second exposure with my shutter release cable (no camera movement) with the jet approaching the light in the same frame.  At this point the light was very distant and just looked like a bright star. As soon as the path of the jet overlapped and intersected the light, I expected to see the jet continue on it&rsquo;s trajectory, bypassing the light in the sky.  I was absolutely startled when the jet disappeared completely from sight at the exact same time that it intersected the light.  It was as if the pilot shut off the strobe lights at the exact same time. &nbsp;There were no clouds in the sky so I&apos;m certain it did not go behind a cloud. After analyzing the image, one would tend to discredit the image since the light appears to follow the exact same trajectory as the stars as the jet is approaching.    However, before the image was taken, the light was much closer, much brighter, and clearly traveled in multiple directions in the sky.",

At about 11:05pm I saw lights over a line of trees to my left from inside of my car. I kept driving down the road until the trees to my left ended and I came to an intersection where the traffic light was red. I stopped at the intersection and rolled down my driver side window and I could see the lights traveling horizontally from west to east across the horizon. There were about 20 - 30 lights in the sky traveling in pairs one on top of the other. As they moved across the sky, the pairs would switch spots within the formation (the one on the bottom would move to the top).  When the light turned green, I pulled into a parking lot of a restaurant, which was closed for the night, and continued to watch them move across the sky. I was in the parking lot for about 3 minutes and I decided to keep traveling east on McGregor. As I pulled out of the parking lot, I kept followin! g the lights with my eyes. I came to another intersection and took a left to turn around (to go west on McGregor). While I was waiting for the light to turn green I noticed 7 lights identical to the ones that were traveling across the horizon and saw that they were stationary and in a tight formation. The formation was 3 lines. One line was at a 90 degree angle, and the other 2 at a 45 degree angle, with one on the right and left and they all met in the middle with the other light in the formation.At this point, I called my wife and told her about what I saw. She told me to go pick her up from home because she wanted to see the lights. I picked her up, but once we got there the lights were gone. Traveling home and back took about 20 minutes.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

It was absolutely stationary for about 10 minutes, then another orb appeared as if it were a light being turned on. The second orb was identical to the first and appeared to the right and slightly higher than the first.  They both remained completely stationary in relation to the surface of ocean and to each other.No way these were stars.  It was still light out and slightly hazy and the objects were slightly above the ocean.There were literally thousands of people in and around the beach so others must have seen it.

20100424,20100424," Beaufort, SC", circle,6 minutes,"2 Black circles moving in a straight line.As I was walking out of my house I checked the time, it was 7:52pm.  I was taking out the garbage. Once outside I glanced toward the western sky and saw what I first thought was a large black bird(buzzard)gliding through the air on wind/thermal current. As I continued to watch I noticed it was moving in a straight line, no wing flaps, no variation from the southwest to north east direction it was moving.  I realised that it was no bird and thought maybe a ballon. It was a black circle moving in a straight line.I then realised that it could not be a ballon, because there was no deviation in it&apos;s path, i.e. no floating or oscillating movements as baloon would with wind currents. I then quickly went inside to get my binoculars. Back outside I focused on the object.I noticed it was solid black, not reflecting any light at all. Kind of a flat black if you will. It was also a perfect circle! Not egg shaped like most baloons being round at the top and more narrow at the bottom.  Anyways I as watched through the binocs it had nothing attached(i.e.string)no lights, no markings whatsoever. I would guess it was about 2-3k feet up, making no sound at all. The thing that puzzled me so was that it flew in a straight line, never deviating from it&apos;s path. I watched for maybe 3 mins until it flew out of sight in the distance.  It was moving around 25-30 mph. Not very fast at all.Well I go back inside wondering what I had just seen, when I decided go back out to make sure I closed the lid on outside garbage. I still had binocs in hand. While outside I looked back to the area where I first spotted the circle and lo and behold there is a second one exactly like the first moving in the exact same manner and path as well as speed.  I estimate these thing were no more than 2-3 feet wide. I checked the time and it was 7:56pm. I also watched this object through the binocs until it flew out of sight. It looked identical to the first object.I went back inside and checked local weather radar on cable TV. The winds were light 3-5 mph out of the southeast. If it were big ballons they would have been traveling in a straight line against a cross wind! I have no idea what I saw, but I know what they were not(bird,or baloon). The Sun was setting but there was still plenty of daylight.  Weather was clear with light clouds. These black circles stood out very well against the sky. If anyone had been in our area and looked up they would have easily spotted the objects. I know people see alot of things, some explainable, some not. But two perfectly shaped circles, black, travelling in precise straight lines with no deviations in their path is really weird.

Then I realized it wasn&rsquo;t moving at all and my visibility got better to where I could tell the height wasn&rsquo;t much at all.Along the bottom it had white lights that were circling it. The reason I know the lights were moving and not a blinking sequence is because there was a small obvious break in the lights. At the top it appeared to have two smaller lights one red and one white.I decided to keep driving and try to get a closer look to figure out what exactly I was seeing. As I approached the bottom lights turned off and all I could see vaguely were the top lights. It still seemed a distance away at that point.

Cowichan more precisely, during sunny weather with only a few clouds and maybe a high haze, while I was driving down Kingsview Rd from &apos;The Properties&apos; on the W slope of Mt Tzuhalem, as I approached the bottom where it comes to a T with Maple Bay Rd, I spotted something small in the air somewhere over Quamichan Lake, maybe 1km away I estimate.It was reflecting the sun (to the upper left) and had some sort of dark attachment, either above or below it - I&apos;m sorry I can&apos;t remember clearly as I only saw it for a few secs.. but it was rising quickly.  As you would expect, my mind was racing thru the various possibilities as to ID - small helicopter/plane or model of such.. mylar balloon, etc - none seemed to fit. (If it were a plane, model or real, I think I would have seen wings.) I could not pull over to watch it as there was traffic behind me and no room to pull over, not to mention going down steep hill, so as I descended toward the main Rd I lost sight of it behind the trees along that road.  But just seconds later, after turning onto that rd in the short merge lane I found I had a clear view out over the lake, and there were no longer any vehicles behind me, so I could pull over and try to relocate it. The only trees were now to my far left, but pretty open view otherwise. There was nothing to be seen in the sky.  It had to have hightailed it out of there pretty fast to disappear like that. When I saw it I could see it against Mt Prevost in the background (beyond the lake and on the other side of Hwy 1), which provided good contrast to see the obj. Some of its rapid upward motion could have been caused by my decent, but I&apos;m sure that effect only added to its real motion.I could not figure out why I could no longer see it anywhere around, after only a few seconds. I wondered if the power line crossing the main rd over to Kingsview had been reflecting the sun as I came down, viewing it almost end-on.  So I got back in my car and spun around to go back up the hill and down again to recreate the effect, but the power line was too low to have caused it. There goes that theory..  I&apos;m quite certain it was out over the lake, maybe 1km from me, almost level with my line of sight and the Mtn in the background, but quickly rising.  It had to be very shiny to reflect the sun like that, but couldn&apos;t have been very large - no bigger than a small helicopter. So it still could have been something mundane like that but even with choppers you can usually see them flying away in 1 direction or other, they can&apos;t move that fast! Hope this is detailed enough considering the banality of the sighting as compared with others, but it was actually my first sighting in 34yrs of life and felt I should report it. Wish it could be less vague.",

20100426,20100426," Elk Grove, CA", sphere,8 min,"Chrome sphere(s) over farmland outside Sacramento California spotted from twin prop passenger aircraftI was flying on a twin propeller engine passenger aircraft from Palm Springs to Sacramento. i spotted a total of 3 seperate sphere&apos;s traveling in straight lines in different directions, they appeared one at a time and no two were visible at the same time. there was one, then 2 minutes later another, then 4 minutes later the final one appeared and flew out of sight just as the first two had. The aircraft was approximately 20-30 minutes south of Sacramento. i was sitting in the window seat on the left side (facing forward) of the aircraft looking out the window trying to pass the time. i often have my nose glued to the window looking out during flights so it&apos;s not unusual  or random that i was gazing out the window at that particular moment. i observed the first sphere traveling above the ground heading south westish (based on the assumption that we were indeed traveling North). it was very difficult to determine speed and size of each sphere because I was tra! veling in the airplane. the airplane i was in was traveling about 10-12K feet, or however high those airplanes fly during travel(horizon airlines). we were at cruising altitude, that is, we never appeared to go any higher than that for hours at a time, and only descended for landing.The first sphere was like a ball of light, likely emitting light rather than reflecting (although if this ball was chrome or mirrored as was the second, it COULD also have been simply reflecting sunlight). since it never lost its brilliance, i assume it was emitting light rather than reflecting. i got the brief impression that it was lite-green in color.  this sphere was farthur from my eyes and closer towards the earths surface so i could observe it for about 6 seconds before it flew out of line of sight from my little window. i was taken by slight surprise by this because it was the first one and moderately gained my attention. it seemed to be traveling quickly, faster than the cars traveling nearby. i would approximate the size of this one to be slightly larger than a minivan. if one were to crush a short school bus into a sphere that would be about the size, approximately. again very hard to determine considering that i was in a moving airplane at about 10K feet.Continuing to stare out the window, i was eager to see it again. between this sighting and the next i could see a small small recreation/agriculture airplane and make out the fusalage from the wings. so i&apos;m very confident that this first object (along with the subsequent 2) was a perfect sphere, not birds or planes. and i&apos;m very confident that the first object was in motion. so after a brief minute or two another one flew by, this time it was headed directly in the direction we had come from. this second sphere was what really got me intruiged, this one appeared to be less than 300 ft away from the aircraft. Way close! it traveled at the same altitude, didn&apos;t go up or down, it was traveling in a straight line directly south.  this sphere was definately chrome in color, about the size of a minivan. it was very hard to determine if it was just floating there or traveling rather slowly. if it was floating in place and the airplane passed over it (not directly because i could st! ill see it from the windows on the side of the plane) it would appear to the observer to be moving. so it&apos;s difficult for me to determine if it was moving in a straight line south or whether it was simply floating. i asked several people in front and behind my seat (same seating oreintation) if they &quot;saw that?&quot;. i was frustrated that they hadn&apos;t and I had caused a minor disturbance on the plane because i was frustrated that nobody was looking out the window because they would have also seen it. i was mad that they missed this event because they had their face in a book. i was essentially trying to find another witness but nobody else claimed they saw it. accepting that this was likely to be a personal experience i let it go and continued to press my nose against the window. several minutes later i spotted the final and most distant sphere. this was bright in color, no hints of green, only white, bright white. this one was traveling West, of the three seperate objects, this one appeared to be closest to the ground. upon landing, i found a pilot sitting in the small Sacramento Airport that we were awaiting our flight transfer at. i asked him if he knew what a chrome colored sphere shaped object would be doing in the air? he immediately suggested a balloon and i was disappointed at the thought that a balloon makes sense. weather balloon or party balloon. so i then asked him how many balloons he has seen in the air during his career (excluding hot air balloon), he responded with zero balloons. i described our flight path and he said, &quot;aah, yes i just flew on that flight&quot;. unspecific to whether he was pilot or co-pilot, i will never forget his face, broad jaw like Elvis, i could spot him anywhere. he also admitted to having not seen the objects (or at least the up close chrome ball) for himself. i was the sole witness. 3 spheres, one at a time, first one was lite-greenish headed opposite direction of plane, the second was way close and i got a very good look at it for the breif 2 seconds it was in sight. my eyes were able to lock on and focus on it before it dissappeared out of my line of sight, it was traveling in roughly the same direction as the first. and the third was faint, bright white and headed westward towards Pacific ocean. i have seen footage of an identical chrome sphere in a ufo clip filmed in Ventura California. i had always been intruiged by ufo&apos;s but after this sighting of mine i became very interested for approx 7 months before i was satisfied and no longer interested in persueing clips online or reading such books.i was 20 yrs old. I have a difficult time believing that it (second Chrome sphere) was a balloon, a little girl would have to run into a random farm field and release it. im not sure if balloons remain inflated at that altitude. NOAA uses whether balloons that look very very similar to it, but i doubt that NOAA would release such a balloon in a flight path especially considering that they are aware of wind direction and speed, if this was a whether balloon, it definately posed a danger to the propellers. too close for comfort.",

20100426,20100426," Dominican Republic (off coast of),", sphere,5 minutes,"Bright sphereical light rising from ocean surface observed from cruise shipOn the evening of Wednesday April  21 , 2010, my wife and I had returned to our room aboard a ship cruising the Caribbean.  At 11:40 p.m. we went out on to the balcony to enjoy the night air.  We were passing to the east of the Dominican Republic after leaving St. Thomas earlier that afternoon.Just after going out on the balcony I noticed a while spherical shaped light out on the water a couple of hundred yards out form the ship. I remarked to my wife, &quot;What&apos;s that light out there&quot;?  She said, &quot; It&apos;s a ship&quot;. But then I pointed out that there wasn&apos;t a ship to be seen and the light didn&apos;t look like a ship light. It was very intense, bright white, and there were no other lights around. Within seconds of saying this, the light began to rise up from the ocean surface. It reached a height of approximately 30 degrees above the horizon. After rising up the light appeared to be more spherical. It then began to perform acrobatic maneuvers. The object would move along a few seconds in one direction then dart back across the sky at a nearly 180 degree angle from the direction it was traveling. As we were seeing this we pointed the object out to a group on a balcony just above us. They confirmed that we were all seeing the same thing.The object darted around in the sky for a few minutes then moved back down to the ocean surface. As it moved down, it appeared to be coming right at the ship. All of us watching the object kind of stepped back and had a moment wondering if the object was going to come all the way to the ship. As the object approached the ship, about 150 yards out, it went into the water. We could see the light under the water for a few seconds, and then it disappeared.While watching the object my wife and I were talking to the other witnesses making comments like, &quot;Are you seeing what I am seeing?&quot;, &quot;Wow!&quot; and variations of &quot;Holy Crap!&quot;. We confirmed with each other that we had all seen the same thing.There is no doubt we all saw the same thing. However, none of us had any idea what we had just seen. The object moved in ways I never seen a manmade flying object move before. It cut and darted faster than any bird I&apos;ve ever seen. At times it moved so fast it was hard to track it moving across the sky. Then it would stop.It was an incredible event. I have no idea what the object&apos;s origins or purpose was. I have no idea if it was man made or of some other origin. If it was man made, we have  craft that can do some incredible maneuvering. That it went into the water and disappeared  made it all the more incredible and all the more mysterious to me. I have no way of knowing other than the what I saw and the feeling I got while seeing it, but I&apos;m pretty sure we all saw something not of human making. I could be wrong. Its possible we have some fantastic craft. But if I had to bet, what we saw did not come from humans of this time frame.",

20100427,20100427," Broomfield, CO", sphere,60 Seconds,"A young man in Colorado witnesses three objects interacting in sky, performing impossible maneuvers.Tuesday, April 27th, 2010 should be noted as a particularly fair-weathered, cloud-free day.  At the time of this incident there were no clouds visible, the sun was at my back, and no known aircraft could be seen or heard at this specific time.  Living relatively close to an airport, I&rsquo;m very familiar with the daily sights and sounds of small aircraft and helicopters.  I was sunbathing this afternoon while on the telephone with my sister when a flash of light caught my attention from the corner of my eye.  The flash of light was relative to sunlight reflected by a mirror from a distance.  When I focused my attention toward the eastern sky I had a difficult time identifying exactly what I was witnessing at that moment.  I saw three spherical/disk-like objects flying in what appeared to be a perfect equilateral triangle formation.  These three, separate objects appeared to be metallic and continued to reflect light, but appeared darker on the bottom.  Perhaps the darke! r appearance on the bottom was an effect of shade.  However, the shade theory is merely speculation.  Although the objects were indeed reflecting sunlight, they did not emit any other light whatsoever.The three, separate objects held their perfect equilateral triangle formation for approximately 30 seconds. They appeared to be fading in and out of my plain of sight flying rapidly, sharply in a direct east to west motion while maintaining the triangular formation. Each separate object appeared to be twice the size of how the planet Venus appears in the night sky. One of the objects was flying at a slightly higher elevation than the two objects below. The appearance of these three objects was specifically puzzling as they appeared as if they were out of focus, exhibiting an almost hazy appearance. I live at approximately 5,500 feet above sea level. Using the western mountain peaks as a reference I estimate that these objects were flying at altitudes between 8,000 and 12,000 feet above sea level. Their low-altitude flight level could be compared to the altitude of a south-bound, ascending plane from the nearby airport, which is within a five mile radius of my home. Despite t! heir low altitude, no sounds could be heard. If I would have held a ruler to the sky to measure their distance apart, they appeared about &frac34; of an inch from each other. They were not spread throughout the sky, they were tightly grouped in the equilateral triangle formation for the first 30 seconds of this occurrence.After the first 30 seconds had passed I moved toward the eastern side of my deck for a prolonged view as the objects were slowly creeping north. Suddenly these three objects began flying in circles around each other. The circular patterns they flew around each other were perfect circles which could be compared to the circular motions demonstrated by braiding three sections of hair. Weaving in a very calculated manner from left to right, up and down. They repeated this pattern 2-3 times in a matter of 10 seconds. The three objects then altered their path, all three of them were flying in completely random circles around each other similar to how flies would buzz around each other. During both patterns of circular, weaving motions the three objects became so close to each other it was difficult to discern one from the other at times. This confirmed that what I was witnessing was indeed not a small aircraft or a helicopter. I am aware of the kinds of maneuvers our known aircraf! ts are capable of and these three separate objects were not demonstrating ordinary or technical maneuvers, these maneuvers were absolutely mind-boggling.The objects maintained their relative position in the eastern sky, slowly making their way toward the north while holding their altitude. Believing the objects would hold their position I bolted inside the sliding glass door of my bedroom and swiftly grabbed my digital camera. With the objects still within sight it was obvious they had returned to their original equilateral formation in those few seconds, exactly as it was earlier; fading in and out of my plain of sight. While fumbling with my camera to set it to video mode, the objects had moved far enough to the north and east that they were no longer visible. Minutes later the sounds of small aircraft could be heard once again, and were beginning to come within sight. I later contacted the Federal Aviation Administration who referred me to the National UFO reporting center per section 6 of FAA regulations regarding Safety, Accident, and Hazard Reports, 7-6-4. Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) Reports.What were these three objects? Why three patters? Why a triangle? How did these objects manage these impossible maneuvers? Why the middle of the day? Why Colorado?  My sighting today has left me with many understandable, unanswered questions. The most poignant of all these questions is: When will I experience a second sighting?? Until then I will keep my eyes on the skies whenever possible.",

Following this the shape changed and appeared to move north. The movement was not rapid. We had stopped the car to watch what was going on.

Any and all planes I&apos;ve ever saw have strobes or red light or both. I live in the country outside of town so planes never fly over my house at all unless they are rerouted due to a storm is the only time I&apos;ve ever seen them fly over. Anytime a plane flys over me I will hear it after it passes. Delay in sound. I have also spotted sattellites before.  They look like a star way out above the atmosphere moving slowly across the sky.  Ok what I witnessed was neither a plane nor satellite looking whatsoever.  I was in my backyard facing south towards Dallas tx when to the southwest of me maybe gainsville tx area a bright light moving towards me caught my attention.  My first thought was a that&apos;s deffinatly not a plane.I immediatly thought a satellite.  Well it was moving very fast and as it became closer I notice it was not very high in the sky and it was to bright to be a satellite.  It actually passes right over my house.Well when I first see it it&apos;s to my southwest ,passes over my house I run around the side of my house And it&apos;s now heading away from me now because it had flew over my house but was heading northeast the whole time. It&apos;s was flying lower than a commercial airline.  As it went over my house the light was very bright.  It was a clear night with the moon shining.  I don&apos;t wanna say for sure but when it was directly above me it seemed to be a circle or triangular shaped craft but the light on bottom made me unsure exactly what shape it was.  The only reason I saw a bit of a shape for a second was because of the moonlight and position Of the craft at that moment.  There was absolutly no sound whatsoever from it.  From the time I spotted it to the time it went over my house and flew totaly out of site took only a minute to a minute and a half.  It happened about 4 hrs before I wrote this. I hope someone else saw it or it can be explained.  It pretty well traveled across the whole sky in 1 min 30 sec. I&apos;ve sat and watched aiplanes fly for sometimes 5 to 10 minutes before I can&apos;t see them a! nymore and we are talking about planes in the distance with blinking lights.  I am 99% sure it was not a plane we k ow of or a satellite flying across the sky in our atmosphere.  I&apos;d say it was approximatly 10,000 to 15,000 feet from the ground. I jus hope more comes of it becuz it was only 4 hrs ago. I know that there had to be others around here that saw it I jus don&apos;t know yet. I am buying a video camera now jus because this incedent hoping to get film of an event like this if I ever see this again but I doubt it. As soon as I saw it I hollered in the house to two of my friends and they came outside and witnessed it but they were not very interested.  They just said it looked strange because they thought planes had blinking lights and not jus one big bright light facing the ground.  The way it was moving was also strange it seemed to speed up then slow down then speed up again.  It didn&apos;t move slowly across the sky like a plane nice and steady it was more jagged like it could! jus take off and be gone in the blink of an eye if it wanted  to.  VERY STRANGE.  Anyways I probly sound crazy and I&apos;m tired of talkin about it because I can&apos;t do anything about it and I have no proof other than 2 witnesses and myself. Hopefully someone else witnessed it and maybe they have it on radar.  Well that&apos;s about all I can say for now thank you",

20100501,20100501," Tulsa, OK", rectangle,3 to 5 minutes,"Witnessed with a friend, a large, rectangular object hovering at sundown in Tulsa, Oklahoma.It was about sundown on a March evening in 1989.  I forgot the exact day.  I was riding in my friend&rsquo;s Jeep and we were heading back to his apartment.  We were stopped at a red light at an intersection heading east.  Up in the Southeastern sky, it looked like a jet airliner was on fire heading down toward Earth.  The smoke and fire cleared after a few seconds and revealed a large, rectangle shaped, solid object.  It had dozens of white lights along the side.  I want to say they seemed to be windows, because the light seemed to be coming from inside the object, not mounted on the outside.The object seemed to be about a football field or so long.  It hovered at treetop level at a fifteen degree angle slowly drifting north about a mile away.  It made no sound. Everyone in their cars at the intersection was freaking out.  All of this took place over about a minute or so, maybe less. It had drifted pretty far North by the time the traffic light turned green.  That&apos;s when we saw and heard fighter jets (lights out) screaming toward the object from the far Southern sky.  As we hurried to try to get under it to get a better view, we lost sight of it for a few seconds because of the trees on the left side of the road.  When we got to the next intersection, the jets flew right over us, and we saw the object way down the street.  I could see the back end of it.  I would guess it was about a mile away, moving faster and much higher in the sky now.  We knew we would never catch up with it.  Almost as soon as we saw it, it quickly moved very high in the sky at an unbelievable speed, and it was gone.About an hour later, I went and told my Dad about it, and drew some sketches. We watched the ten o&rsquo;clock news, as they were going to have a story WITH FILM FOOTAGE of an object seen in the sky that night.  The film they showed was taken by a lady that had been at a local nearby restaurant that evening, and it had that restaurant&rsquo;s sign in the foreground.  But what they showed looked like a falling star, nothing more.  No word from the dozens of witnesses that saw what we saw.  No footage of the object hovering a hundred feet or so off the ground, or any of the rest of it.  They said it was a &quot;Russian satellite falling out of its orbit.&quot;   When those things happen, don&apos;t they know about when and where those things will fall?  I&apos;m all the time hearing weathermen saying things like, &quot;Keep an eye in the Western sky tonight to catch a glimpse of blah blah blah..Over the years, I&apos;ve wondered how many other people saw that, and I&apos;ve wanted to compare notes.  I haven&apos;t been able to find anything in any newspaper of TV. archives that even told the story.Since that night, I&apos;ve questioned everything.  I truly believe the government knows much more than we even believe they do.  I hate to sound like one of those conspiracy freaks, but after seeing undisputable proof that we are not alone, it makes me uneasy to not have the whole story.  Anyway, that&apos;s my story, as best as I can remember it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.  PD))",

The object was cigar shaped, it was vertical and looked like a ray of light in the sky.It sat stationary for about two minutes.  It began to move at the pace of a jet airliner although. Suddenly, it stopped and then sat stationary again for about 30 seconds, after that it began to move closer, maybe a mile, nothing more than that. It started to move around again at a jet airliner pace in the sky but it swayed back and forward. After about five minutes of witnessing the entire phenomena, it quickly dissipated and faded into the atmosphere.  Its camouflage mechanism made it hard to capture a phone picture.  Additionally, the twilight was not helpful in trying to get a photo as the entire sky blended in.Others that witnessed the sunset and the unusual sighting directly following the sunset that evening were talking about it amongst each other although no group made a big deal about it.I should probably mention that I posted a Facebook post about the sighting to my friends and after I posted that, Facebook on my phone coincidentally is all in Spanish and I cannot get it back into English anymore.",

After I finished smoking my cigarette, I decided that it was nice enough out to merit staying out there.  I decided to lie on top of my car and look up at the sky to watch the clouds pass by.  I sat there for about a minute before a saw a red light out of the corner of my eye. It grabbed my attention so i sat up to get a better look. At first, I dismissed it to just being a plane; I see a couple pass pay each day.  Then, as I continued to watch it I realized it couldn&apos;t have been a plane because the entire object was red, almost glowing like a light.  Then, I tried to say it was a a meteor, or some type of fireball, or a flare; but there was no trail of smoke left behind, nor was there a tail on the object.  It was just an glowing, oblong figure. It flew at a relatively constant speed; a little too slow for a plane, though.  It was high enough so that it was above some clouds, but below others. When I initally saw it, it was fl! ying from the north-west and headed towards the south-east.  However, I lost this figure behind the clouds for a moment and when I regained sight of it, it appeared to be headed east; at least a 30 degree change in flight path. I lost it beyond the horizon shortly after.I&apos;m reluctant to call it a UFO just because I like facts and tangible proof.  I wasn&apos;t able to clearly see this object, nor was I up close to it.  The I&apos;m posting this report now is because it seems as though there is no other explanation. When there are planes flying overhead, I hear noise.   There was no noise. It was too bright for there to be stars out.  Plus, it was much to large and oddly shaped for it to be a star.  It was moving too slowly to be a meteor or a fireball.  And, there was no trail of smoke as there would be with a flare. As much as my logical, fact-based mind hates to admit it, I think this could have been a UFO.The thing that really made me post this report, though, is perhaps the most unsettling thing. I came inside to research what it might have been and all that kept appearing in my search results were links to people talking about UFOs. I ended up on this website and decided to look at what other sightings have happened in my state.

Smaller at the bottom tapering to somewhat larger where it was joined with the large disc section.

As I was walking I was looking up across the top of the hotel for a hawk that usually picks off pigeons and stuff.  I then noticed an object, not directly above the hotel, but from my line of sight I can surmount that it was just a little bit further out over the city.

I watched it for about 3-5 minutes then I ran inside, down to the maintenance room to see if the engineering guys had any binoculars.  There weren&apos;t any so I ran back up to the front to see if any guests had arrived, everything was clear so I immediately ran to the back again because the sun and trees obscured my vision in the front.  When I got back, I searched for it and was able to find it again, still there not moving.  Total time elapsed so far would of been about 8 minutes.  I watched it for another 2 or so minutes until I was interrupted by my radio that a guest needed assistance in the front.

I positioned myself in the shade of the roof line to mask the sun from my shots.I downloaded the pictures, from my camera to my computer, late in the afternoon to see if I was successful in capturing the colorful effects of the sun.  As I visually scanned the pictures, I noticed several outstanding white circular blots which appeared at several locations in each of the pictures.  Some were relatively close to others, some were larger and more prevalent than others, but all except one, were, by my estimation, at an extreme distance in the sky.  I counted no less than eight objects on one of the three pictures I took and found there to be two to three objects on the second photo and five, maybe more on the other.One image appears very much larger or closer and lower than the rest:  it is spherical in shape and has what appears to be a dark belt (almost like a wind shield) wrapping horizontally around the mid-section of the sphere.  I cannot describe this image in better detail, because it is out of focus.  I thought, at first, that I might have captured a portion of my old TV antenna array, but I can&apos;t visualize this, even if it is out of focus.  And the antenna is farther to the left of where I took these pictures. In trying to give this object some size or distance perspective with the surroundings in the picture, I note it is at the bottom of the picture, just above the roof line and almost gives the appearance of a head-on frontal aspect of a jetliner, but there are no wings, rudder, or elevators in view.  Additionally, I saw no aircraft while I was taking these pictures, though the Providence airport is in the direction of my photos.I checked the other two photos to see if the same images appeared, or if they were at the same relative locations on each picture, thinking perhaps my lens might be dirty, and if so, the spots would be observable on them too, but this was not the case. I thought for a moment, that I might be seeing some very bright stars as an anomally, but ruled this out as these sightings are so close to the sun.I cannot tell whether these objects had any relative motion, or how long they may have been observable since I didn&apos;t even notice them when I took the pictures.

I walked down to the far end of the balcony towards my neighbors front door, I turned around to come back to my area of the balcony, and as I turned I rested my hands on the wooded side of the balcony, and I looked up. I noticed a dark shadow moving west directly above me very slowly. As my eyes began to focus, I clearly saw the outline of a very large rounded boomerang shape ship with no lights. I could make out the outline very well. I would guessed it to be flying at between 2500-3000 feet, because it appeared to be lower than the mountains, which are around 3200 feet. The ship was more rounded like a half a circle with sharp points or horns coming off of it, sort of like a Chinese throwing star. It was low enough that it was reflecting light off of the bottom part of the ship. From the reflection I could clearly see that it was a sliv! er/light color. The object slowly faded away in the distance. The entire experience was surreal and very eerie. On the same night at 11:05PM, I also saw 2 bright orbs connected to one another to what appeared to be a rod of some sort. They traveled in the same direction as the other object, however they moved much faster, and the objects appeared to circle each other as it moved across the sky heading west.

Me and my mother and grandfather are having a conversation on the supernatural. To the left right after 9:00 pm, we see a white light, small and distant, but large enough for us to notice. We thought it was a star, but after 10 minutes my grandma came out and said that it couldn&apos;t be because there would be a lot of stars. We were staring at it, also me remembering having this same experience about a year ago. It wasent moving, or doing anything. My grandma said that when she went to Serbia after the bombing in 1999, they saw something like this, but this was much more strange. Later, everybody went inside. Me being a freak on these things, I sit there at about 9:10 pm and am texting my friends and about to send message on facebook telling them to look outside, as I do this, I see it bounce as I am keeping an eye on it, ad watch it dissapear. Now the skies were clear that night. I get dressed into pajamas, come back out. Before I saw it to the left of my porch (facing west), but now I saw an object, I was facing south-east. It was the same, white circleish figure I saw before, but also I saw one on other side glimmering. They didn&apos;t move at this time. I&apos;m staring, thinking.

As I walked further into the parking lot and looked up there were about 12 red lights in the sky. For size perspective they looked rather like low flying aircraft lights, but there was only one light per object and the light was all I could see of the object. The lights were grouped roughly in a V formation.At first I thought that there were two irregularly shaped disks leading the formation but as objects raised and lowered in altitude as they moved south it became clear that the fairly low (but light) cloud cover meant that as objects raised above the cloud cover the light from the object reflected down below as a dark disk shape through the cloud.The objects were moving fairly slow and not as steady as I have seen most aircraft fly (more of a bobbing motion). They were moving not in unison but definitely as a group of some sort. I did not get a firm count because I would loose/see more as they changed altitude. This took place in an urban area and I lost sight as the objects moved out of my line of sight into the tree line/buildings. About another 10 or so people witnessed this in the parking lot that I was in. There is a National Guard unit stationed ~15 miles away, and there are several small airports, but none that I know of that would be doing any kind of experimental aircraft work, etc.",

I still didn&rsquo;t believe my eyes so I began to move slowly and the object came to a standstill again and I immediately stopped the car and the object began to move away from me once more.  It moved slowly at first but then picked up speed and did a quarter circle turn heading north. I kept my eyes on the sky and about 30 seconds after it was out of view a military airplane, flying low and silent, came flying over head moving in the same direction the object was going. I only recognized the plane because I had seen it before on 9/11 after all commercial planes had been grounded and only military aircraft was in the air that night.

United States I observed the following; I was sitting on the couch in the living room when I heard my wife yelling&rsquo; &ldquo;babe you gotta see this&rdquo;, I ran to the side porch and observed two large orange lights that seemed to be floating upwards. My view was obstructed by a tree in my side yard so I ran with my wife to the street where I observed a total of six (6) round, bright orange lights that seemed to be at a very low altitude coming from the North and gaining altitude slowly as they headed south.They seemed to follow each other in more of a floating manner like a balloon, than that of a helicopter or other aircraft. The objects made no sound. I do not believe these objects were balloons because of their size which on a pretty clear night seamed huge. From my perspective they appeared to be about a half a mile away at their closest (about a minute after we first spotted them). And again, (from my perspective) they appeared to be the size of a bus or larger only round and bright orange. I called my daughter and her boyfriend outside with her phone to try and get video but was unable, they also saw the object&rsquo;s towards the end of the incident.From beginning to end, we probably only observed the object&rsquo;s for maybe two minutes, but I will never forget those two minutes. As the objects floated upwards they disappeared into high clouds, we also observed some type of aircraft flying towards the object&rsquo;s as they disappeared.A passer by walked up and said, &ldquo;Did you just see that, what was it!&rdquo; we all went inside and expected to see &ldquo;the lights&rdquo;, all over the news and internet, but can&rsquo;t find anything??

The object stopped and began to grow very bright and changed from an off white to a light orange before receding. it stayed still for a few more seconds and then began to &quot;wiggle&quot; again before shooting off in the general direction of south.

Was ridiculed for it by my family for what I am about to write.I am of the age of 35 yrs and almost 20 yrs ago, a friend and I were honestly getting ready to head to the lakes about a mile from my home at the time to have a few beers.  Mind you we hadn&apos;t had any to drink at this point.We pulled up to about the end of the lake, &ldquo;they were man made lakes for reservoirs,&rdquo; and parked the car got out and cracked our first beer.  This was around 9:30 pm..  The year was I believe 1990 and it was around march , &ldquo;what day I could not be sure,&rdquo;.  Anyhow we just cracked our first beer and looked over to the north east toward cape Canaveral fl.We noticed a luminescent orange light emerging from the ground. Our first reaction was what is that?  I said it&apos;s the shuttle. My friend says , &ldquo;no couldn&apos;t be I didn&apos;t hear anything on the news about a launch&rdquo;. I said, &ldquo; Me either but there it is.The strange thing is that it looked to be traveling straight up and  at a very slow accent. My friend also noticed this and said that&apos;s weird. I agree. And sure as he said that it looked to have shot straight up what looked to be at least  2 miles up within the blink of an eye.We then noticed it coming in our direction. After seeing it move toward us we guessed it to be at least 3to4 miles away. It was over the lake not more than 50 yards in front of us within less than three seconds. Our initial reaction was holy sh** what the f**k is that.My friend and I got in the care shaking trying to put the keys in the ignition. I told him how many time in your life will you see this again? So we stayed. I remember it being shaped like a slender oval. It reflected the moonlight and the moon as would a mirror and had two lights on top swaying back and forth touching each other. No noticeable windows or anything.I don&apos;t think they knew we were there. I believe it was purely accidental we saw them that close because when I opened the car door to get a better look, &ldquo; this thing at an angle straightened up shot side to side across the lakes at what appeared to now be a white light. It shot back and forth within 2 seconds stopped  at the end of the lakes and just shot off towards west palm bch fl you didn&apos;t have time to even close your eye and it was gone.We both agreed that we had just seen what we had seen. I told him we should tell someone. He said sh** I&apos;m not telling anyone there going to think your f***ing crazy. I went home told my mom and brother who both till this day call me a liar and just don&apos;t believe.Look I wasn&apos;t a believer in this. Never told stories like this in my whole life about seeing things. Yet how can you help what you see. I am now and always will be a believer.The story gets better. For about a week after I noticed what appeared to be a white light resembling a star would always be on the right of the cars I would be in and would also change direction with the car as we would turn there it would be on the right side of the car. Weird I thought at first until I thought that no other stars do that so what the f am I going crazy?  I kept telling my girlfriend at the time and she about thought I was going crazy too. Until about 6 days after the initial sighting I noticed from my house back by the lakes a light. Looked like a spot light from a helicopter.I told my girl do you see that? She said it&apos;s just a plane or something like that. So out of all last hope I grabbed my lighter , &ldquo;I know sounds stupid,&rdquo; and began flickering in click click click pause click pattern. My girl looked at me like I was crazy. Can you blame her. Everyone else thought I was crazy. Until I noticed the light got real bright and flickered the same pattern. My girl said that was co-incidence so I did it again in a different pattern.And once again it did also. At this point my girl even said that&apos;s weird. I noticed the light starting to come our direction and as it got closer we heard the sound of a prop plane. My girlfriend then said see I told you it was a plane and I said no crap your right. At this moment the prop plane sound changed to what sounded like a helicopter . I started to trip at this point and I asked my girl if she just heard that thing change sound. She said yes. And at that moment it sounded like it changed to the sound of a single jet propulsion engine.The light began to get closer and as it came by the street in front of the house the light dimmed out to almost nothing and the sound just stopped. And there it was again and my girl saw it with her own eyes and starting crying and saying I want to go inside. I told her to look and tell me I am not crazy and she said I see it I see it I want to go in the house.I told her to go inside and get my mom and her husband , &ldquo;at the time,&rdquo; and tell them to come out the back door and look up over the house in the back yard . This thing was 30 ft high and probably 30 ft in front of us. By the time my mom and her husband came out I watched this thing start flickering and moving up down left right and random patterns as fast as the eye could see and disappeared . My mother said that I talked about it so much to my girl that I convinced her to see this in living color and she saw it only because I convinced her to see this, my girl I mean. She even told my mother and they did not believe us. If I was that convincing to make someone see that then put me on ripleys or I am in the wrong line of work. Oh well I know what I saw and have not seen it in almost 20yrs.Moved to wis. And recently strange things have occurred over the last two weeks that I can not explain. White star like object sitting in the sky around dusk very similar to the one I thought was around for a week prior to the second sighting when I was sixteen. Noticed every night for last two weeks at least ten times this has occurred. Will watch the star slowly descend and turn to amber orb no visual shape other than amber or every once in a while it changes colors but mostly amber. Sits there and moves slow almost as if to get my attention. Will watch it fade out to nothing and light will reappear bright white and turn amber and move slightly . Call this strange but it is really weir-ding me out .   After 19 yrs what the hell is it and why does it keep coming back . Have looked around environment and questioning it you know , &ldquo; maybe it&apos;s a street light , but come up with the same answer. It&apos;s not! Reason: It has not been here every night.  I&apos;ve seen this thing at least! 10 times and on a couple of clear nights its not there and 30min later there it is . So if anyone can help me solve this riddle pls do.Note: I have never been abducted nor have I ever seen an alien being, just what I saw when I  was sixteen and now again almost 20 yrs later. Have never been inside of this thing or anything like this.Just a color changing orb appears at close range.Is it possible after one has a close encounter for these things to show up and let you know at a distance that they are back or am I just fortunate enough to see this again ? And if so why ? Haven&apos;t seen or looked up in almost 20 yrs . Tried to forget what I saw. This all started 4/14/2010 right before the meteor event. Saw these lights before the meteor and have 9 other occasions over the last 2 weeks.I know I am not nuts considering I haven&apos;t seen this in 19 yrs and not the same.

We watched as its movements were irratic at times and at one time before it completely disappeared it came closer and then backed away and then disappeared.Within about 5 minutes it reappeared in the same area and to the right of it a red object appeared in the sky.The red object moved faster than any jet we had ever seen. It was if it was encircling the the white object. Then all of a sudden they disappear and we see flashes of white light as if someone was taking a picture and the flash was so bright.By now our neighbors were outside watching the activity and we noticed all the planes coming into our airport were circling away and we noticed jets taking off in the direction of the ufos. All of a sudden we hear a sonic boom and we look at the traces in the sky from the jets heading in that direction.I tried to video tape the red object and the happenings afterwards but for some odd reason I could not get it to film, all I got was static across my screen as I tried to film it.Witnesses: 1.

We were sitting in a field with no obstruction of the sky and the weather was clear with no clouds.  The fireworks were not being used and were not scheduled for another 30 minutes, so no confusion with any other object was possible.  As I was looking at the stars i noticed a bright white light moving from the horizon which was the west heading eastward.  It appeared to be very high in the sky and was moving quite fast for the altitude. I mentioned it to my wife who looked up and saw the light.  At that time when she acknowledged it , it disappeared for about 3 seconds after a flash and reappeared further along in the same path of flight. When it did this she told her family to look, it did the flash again and reappeared two more times.  It then flashed and reappeared after what seemed a be 90 degree turn and headed south.  It flashed and reappeared three times and was at the tree line to our south.  The complete event occured within thirty seconds and covered the distance of the far westward horizon to very close to the center of sky above us, then to the far southern horizon.

It was very shiny as if the sun was reflecting off of it. It seemed to be mostly shaped like a rocket.  There was no sound, no lights, no smoke. It looked like it was floating with the front  of it a little lifted. It was not going slow or going fast.  Several people thought maybe a plane but it did not look or sound like a plane.

I saw that it was a black flying wing/chevron shaped craft made of just 2 wings joined together at an angle of approximately 160 degrees. Each wing was a long narrow black rectangle; the &quot;wingtip&quot; edges did not taper at all and were squared off at 90 degrees, but with rounded corners. Arrayed along these wings were 7 round, white, non-blinking lights equidistant from each other and the front and rear edges, from tip to tip; the fourth central light was right on the central axis where the 2 wings would join (if they were separate pieces). The diameter of each of these 7 lights was approximately 50% of the width of the wing from the front edge to the back edge.It is very difficult to judge never having been close to the craft to get a sense of scale, but its size may have been as much as 180 - 200 feet from left to right, and it may have been traveling at an altitude of 1200 feet. It is also possible that it was a larger craft traveling faster and higher, or a smaller craft traveling lower and slower; at any rate the speed I observed it moving at was almost leisurely. Its direction of movement was due west, or with a very slight northwest component, and it was silent. It was in my line of sight for 3-4 seconds before it moved out of sight behind the roofline of the entrance to the Aria.",

I first noticed it when I blocked out a start. If I were not looking up at the time I would have missed it. I can usually hear passenger jets flying high overhead while they are traveling either eastward or westward, but I heard nothing from this thing.

The neighbors were not keen on the dog as he was a pitbull therefore I put the food out in the wee a.m. hours.  As I was coming back in the house/front door, a light caught my eye to the NW horizon over the cul de sac.  I stopped with my jaw dropped and just stood there to take it in.  I said to myself I am witnessing a close up view of a UFO so I better take this in as I knews it was most likely a once in a life time exp.  It was VERY close, very large and actually just sitting, as parked in the sky. It was actaully quite beautiful, one large craft-appeared to be 3 stories and I know this will sound weird, but it was like somoene had taken the top tier of an office building and parked it in the sky..it had windows...much like you see when you look up at a highrise office building.  It was all lite up with bright white lights-penetrating...as I said quite beauti! ful to take in.  It just sat there and did not move, the back drop was nothing but the black sky...it looked so close that I was tempted to walk towards it to the culdesac to get closer, that is when as I was standing at my front door got a bit spooked and thought I should go in.  I wanted to wake a neighbor to witness but it was the middle of the night thru the week, school-work, and I thought to go upstairs and get my camera, but the batteries are always weak and thought it will be gone when I return...so I went inside, looked out the window and it was still sitting there...then I went back to bed....stupid!!! So wish I had stayed to see it move, but as I mentioned I had taken it in , in great detail, no one to share it with and didn&apos;t want to stay outside any longer by myself.  I didn&apos;t tell any neighbors lest they think I was crazy, and really my prioirty at the time was attempting to rescue the dog (which was a succuss a few days later).  I did share the sighting with ! my immediate family and my best friend and then just filed it ! away as I have never known who to report it to that was reputable and where I could remain annonymus...so it is almost exactly a year later and on my mind I googled and found your site.  I hope this is a reputable site.  I can tell you I have watched, googled many sighting shows etc. since my siting and I have yet to run across anything that was as large and close with such a clear view of what I witnessed.

20100505,20100505," Santa Clarita, CA", formation,12 minutes,"It was around 9:20pm last night (May 4, 2010) and it was pitch black; the sky was clear and we could see the stars, and there was some wind, it was warm.  My husband and I were walking our 2 dogs, and we were passing through the parking lot at Bridgeport Shopping Center, which is at the NE corner of the intersection of Newhall Ranch Road and McBean Parkway, in Valencia, California.  Valencia is part of the incorporated town of Santa Clarita, if you&apos;re searching for it on a map.  Bridgeport Shopping Center has pedestrian walkways and lower buildings - it&apos;s new, and is mostly empty in the evenings, we guess there were about 10 other people around the shopping center at that moment but no one was near us. We were at the far East side of the parking lot where there are few street lights.We were walking East toward Grandview Drive when my husband noticed a long line of red lights in the sky that appeared above the treeline, not too high up, and were acting in a very bizarre fashion. If the lights were on some kind of craft/s then it was completely silent.There were about 12 lights - all RED, no white, and they were in a line, as if connected to a leading edge. At first it was just hovering - for maybe one minute, and then started to slowly float Southeast. The string of lights never descended. We didn&apos;t see a solid shape behind the lights, it was too dark, we could only see the lights themselves. They all seemed to be about the same size. The size of the lights themselves -- relative to a star in the night sky -- they were the same size as the brightest star in the sky. All together, the span of the lights in a line reached almost completely across our entire field of view. They were above the horizon, well above the treeline, and above the rooftops of everything around.It was very hard to gauge where exactly the thing was, we guestimated it was over Eastern Santa Clarita, East of the 5 Freeway, but West of the 14, North of Lyons Avenue and potentially South of Newhall Ranch Road, where we were standing &ndash; although it appeared directly over us. It was a straight line of lights at a 45 degree angle. Like a stick, turned up on an angle. This was the shape &quot;/&quot;, with the tallest part rising on its right side, with the whole thing heading slowly South by SouthEast. It (the string of lights) never broke formation. It slowly floated South-South East until it became so dim we could no longer see it, without ever changing the distances between the lights themselves. They were not evenly spaced. The whole line silently hovered and then slowly floated off, with entire sections blinking on and off randomly. It was very long/wide! As a gauge, if I hold my thumb out away from me (about 2.5 feet) and my thumb represents one of the lights that we saw - then! the whole line of lights took up my entire field of view. (It took about 5 minutes for it to disappear from view.)  Just when we thought the whole line was lit up, another light would blink on, to the far left or far right - making the total string even wider/longer. The lights did not look like flares to me. I have seen flares and these lights were constantly blinking on and off, wildly -- quickly pulsating. There was never a time when all the lights were on uniformly at the same time, they were always shimmering. Sometimes whole sections would just go out and come back on again 10 seconds later, in random order.The lights, always red, were all blinking/shimmering fast, but not uniformly, and not strobing in any regular pattern and with no regular timing, not the way aircraft safety lights would. Any one light also had an irregular pattern. We thought -- could it be a squadron of helicopters? But the lights didn&apos;t behave in a predictable way. These red lights would go on and off in random order and with random timing by first becoming dim, then bright, then dim, then off, and then bright again -- as if they were shimmering. My husband commented that it looked like the special effects on TV when a craft goes into &quot;cloaking&quot; mode, or the way lights look reflected in water. He is a skeptic and he was dumbfounded as to what we were seeing.Position relative to each other: the lights kept their exact distance from one another the whole time, even as the line of lights drifted South. The size of the individual lights was like looking at red car brake lights from 2 miles away. That&apos;s the only way I can describe it - against the night sky they were as bright and big as the biggest/brightest star in the sky. We can&apos;t tell how high the string of lights was, but we couldn&apos;t see any other stars through them. We could not see if it was one solid craft, or many lights. They did remain in a stable position relative to one another - at least giving the illusion that they were along the edge of one craft. I&apos;ve seen sheriff&apos;s dept. helicopters fly nightly over town and I would say these lights appeared to be floating around the same height. They were not too distant, definitely over town, not over the mountains. It took several minutes for them to go a few miles.We ran East along the sidewalk to keep a view of it, and eventually the line disappeared as it floated out of view, and became dimmer, eventually disappearing completely from our line of sight. We stared for 5 more minutes and then started to walk home, heading East toward the edge of the parking lot. Then we saw another set of lights, doing exactly the same thing, just over the treeline to the East of Grandview Road. The line had the same weird pattern of red lights shimmering off and on and lasted for 2-3 minutes but was not quite as wide and was oriented horizontally. It didn&apos;t drift or descend, it just got more and more dim and finally was down to 2 lights, and then disappeared.We stared a little longer, and then walked home. I immediately called the Sheriff station for Santa Clarita. I reported what we saw and the police officer said they had over 100 calls reporting UFOs already that night. He could not say if people reported the same thing we saw.The sky was filled with other aircraft that night, heading into Burbank airport or LAX. They all looked normal compared to this.Our backgrounds: My husband is in IT and I am a technology and sciences editor for a national publication. We&apos;ve never seen anything out of the ordinary before and have lived here 3 years, so we also know what&apos;s common in the sky here. My husband is a firm skeptic, and I&apos;m uncertain. I&apos;m aware of military testing at VAFB and I have seen missile tests at a distance from the 101, and this didn&apos;t look like that.

The object had gone. The ship recorded on Marine Traffic was half as far away again as the object, but was easily distinguished as it was red and we could make out superstructures even from that distance, even without binoculars.I would estimate I was no more than 10 minutes maximum upstairs.

20100506,20100506," Sacramento, CA", light,about 6 min,"Three bright lights low in the night sky almost equidistant from each other over Sacramento, California.I was driving to my home in Sacramento from my work in Roseville, California on southbound Interstate 80. As I approached downtown Sacramento I noticed four very bright stars in the sky over the city. Within seconds I realized that one was a distant airplane (because of the red and green lights that I noticed it exhibited as I looked more closely). The &quot;stars&quot; were about seven full moons apart from each other.As I got closer to the city I could see that the lights were seemingly stationary because their orientation altered naturally with my approach and the turns in the freeway. I apparently was getting closer to them.As I got into town, near the area of Sutter General Hospital the three lights were to my side. The closest of the lights was about five times bigger than a very bright star or five times a magnitude 1 star. It seemed to be around three hundred feet in the air. I tried to notice how far the closest object was from me but I couldn&apos;t tell. At first it looked closer than my exit which was coming up (the 16th Street Exit) but as I approached the exit I could see it was farther away... perhaps twice as far.Still, I knew these were not stars nor some other regular natural celestial phenomena. As I approached them they were in front of me; when I got closer they were next to me and then as I went further they were behind me and they were low in the sky.I had seen them from the vantage of the freeway but as I took the exit which descended onto the surface streets the objects were lost amidst buildings and trees and I could not see them again.In all I saw the objects for about six minutes. Because I was driving on the freeway I could only view them intermittently but, perplexed by their strangeness, tried to make as good an observation as I could and remember as many details as possible.",

All three strobbing red light and bright star appearances.My children 1 and 2 got back and i suggested they watch the sky whwile i put the fire out.

I got up to have a ciggy outside the back door and as I usually do when I go outside at night  I glanced up up to the sky.Just at that moment two bright white lights shot over our house, one just behind the other.  They were going at super fast speed, and I judged them to be quite low (About the same height as the local air ambulance helicopter flies over)  I can only compare the speed of them to war zone footage I have seen on TV of tracer bullets fired at night. they were that fast.It looked like one was tailing the other, and both seemed to be darting slightly from side to side as they travelled forwards. They got to a point just over the school behind our house and without slowing just shot up vertically and then vanished in the cloud. They were completely silent. No noise at all.Al this took maybe a matter of seconds. I was just stood there looking up with my mouth open.

I had no time to get my a camera and film them, and even if I did I think I would have been to preoccupied to think about grabbing it.(I would just like to add, even though I am quite interested in reported UFO sightings, I don&apos;t particularly go looking for them, and wasn&apos;t even sure if I believed in odd things flying around in our skies.  I have never witnessed anything like this before, and even though I am quite rational and like to find possible explanations for stuff like this, after seeing something for myself I have no idea at all what it was.)",

Then It got a little lower but what i really noticed is it started to become more parallel to me at my 9 o&apos;clock so I knew I was right beside it. Past the hills on Woodford I started to notice it become even lower and go even past my 9. So I pulled over on this dirt road (lee witt rd), and I couldn&apos;t see it all. I had lost it in the trees before i turned of 321, then through the trees I noticed a outside light prob from a house and another brighter light, possibly the light itself, much lower now. So I did a 3 point turn and turned back to 321. Then I drove about 30 feet, killed the lights and got out, looking directly NE behind the truck. I saw it again!! Much lower prob 100 feet above the tree line in the distance. So I got! the flashlight,  and went into the field about 6-7 feet and could see it perfectly.

He spoke in a strange accent(even though his english was perfect), the way it came out sounded very monotone and far away.  He didn&apos;t turn away from his magazine and wouldn&apos;t look me in the eyes, which I also found strange.

20100509,20100509," Winterhaven, CA", disk,several hours,"Nine menacing crafts rounded up a large group of campers on the Colorado River during one incredibly long night.On the last Saturday night of March, 1978, I was with a group of friends on a spring break camping trip in a former California State Campground, 18 miles north of Winterhaven California. I say former because the facility had been virtually destroyed by massive flooding from the Colorado River where it had served as a landing for travelers navigating down the River. Before it had been destroyed, it had housed a seasonal general store, as well as a large camping area with large bathroom-shower facilities and Ranger trailer up on a hill overlooking the grounds. But by this year, all of that was gone, and the trailer abandoned by the Rangers but the area was still used by a handful of hardcore campers.During this last Saturday in March, the nine of us were on the peak of last mountain at the farthest end of a chain of foothills that began at the campgrounds and ran north along the Colorado River ending at this last peak overlooking a panoramic view of the entire northwestern desert and river valley below.Before our encounter that night, two truly amazing events occurred.  First we experienced an unexplainable loud buzzing electrical discharges through our hands when flicking our index fingers. We could hear the loud buzz, as well as feel the strong current running through our fingers. This lasted approximately a few minutes and then disappeared.  The second strange anomaly to occur next was - the sunset we watched from the peak lasted a abnormally long time - at least two hours longer than it normally would. We commented on this several times while in progress but no one could explain and unfortunately, no one had a watch to give an accurate accounting. However, it was undoubtedly much longer than can be explained by any normal physical means. And as if that wasn&apos;t strange enough, it ended so abruptly, we were caught completely by surprise in the complete darkness of the night. We normally would have already made the long trek back to camp, a couple of miles through the rug! ged foothills, during the twilight which always proceeds the setting of the sun. But in this case, we were so mesmerized by the incredibly long beautiful smoldering orange glow of the sun which appeared to stick right behind the mountains in the far west, we didn&apos;t leave, we just naturally expected the benefit of the post sunset, slowly fading twilight, which for some reason didn&apos;t happen . . . defying all laws of physics.Once we were confronted with this sudden darkness, we tried to not let it freak us out and gather ourselves for the long treacherously difficult trip back in total darkness, the moon not yet risen, and frankly were a little more than concerned about our safety getting down - especially down the narrow path from the precariously steep cliff we were on - hundreds of feet to the canyon floor below. Anyway, right as we were beginning our descent down, one of our group spotted a star erratically zooming across the night sky in straight lines from point to point. We all began to watch, suddenly pointing to other stars that were behaving in a similar fashion. It didn&apos;t take long for the group of us to realize that they couldn&apos;t possibly be stars but must be lights in our own night sky that just resembled stars. And sure enough, with in a few minutes, they all gathered together in a tight rotating ball growing larger as they dropped out of the night sky in to the distant horizon,! appearing to settle into the river basin several miles northwest up stream from our location.Although below our view, we watched their bright domes of light wind down the river south towards us. In a fairly short time they came into our view as they appeared from around a bend in the river entering our section of the valley. There were nine crafts flying in a diamond formation. They each had several search lights fanning the area as if they were frantically looking for something or someone. As they came underneath us in the washes below, we were, of course, still several hundred feet above on our perch, they suddenly broke formation and shot out in different directions in what appeared to be a co-ordinated military maneuver securing the area.Until this point, they had hovered silently down the river - but when they broke into their frantic search in different directions, their crafts gave off bright flashes of lights and loud crackling blasts of electrical discharges resembling thunder and lighting. I could feel and smell the static electrical energy fields they were creating as they surged about. I could also hear the roar of air they propelled and also the sound of the water being displaced by the rush of air as well. It was amazing how quickly they would move from one point to another - a brilliant flash light with a simultaneous crack of thunder and instantaneously be somewhere else stopped dead but for the roar of moving air which appeared a breaking mechanism.As I said, when they came into our area of washes, they broke out of formation and sped around as if looking for something, as this was happening, a very strange event occurred at the very same time. The other eight people I was with on the ledge began talking amongst themselves as if they were in a different time and place. And no matter how hard I tried to get their attention concerning the fantastic scene unfolding below, they just continued talking to each other seemingly oblivious to it all. In fact I got the distinct impression they were discussing a sunset lasting a very long time. I basically felt they were sacred senseless and were in some kind of fear induced manic behavior which seemed impossible to break, so I gave up trying, turning back to the crafts below which had moved down the river past us to the campground a couple of miles away to our south - except for two craft that had shot below our position inland around the other side of the foothills.Instead of moving on south on the inland side, these two came quickly back to right below us and one of the craft shot up to our position on the ledge and hovered level with me about a hundred feet away - out over the canyon floor. My companions were still completely engrossed, talking frantically to each other, even though I made one last futile attempt to draw their attention to the ship silently hanging in front of us. It was shaped like the Bat plane - with a curved, rounded front, and sweeping back to two large wings comprising the back. The front appeared to have a elongated windshield mimicking the line of the curve - making up about a third of the height of the ship which was probably fifteen to twenty feet. The width at its widest - near the back from one wing to another - was approximately twice its height, maybe more, like fifty feet. It radiated a fluorescent reddish light from underneath that lit up the entire area in a eerie blood like glow. And I could see! equipment like or led lights inside the front windshield. There was also a gentle humming sound similar to an electric train transformer. I felt a pronounced static electrical field like presence engulfing the area.In a matter of a few moments the craft began to rise above me and came closer - to about fifty feet - now I could see the shape, which I described already, because of the glow of the red panels which mimicked the shape of each back wing. It was about as long as it was wide. It was making no noise as it lifted above me and it did this very slowly and gently with just the faint transformer hum.As soon as it was directly above me - a green spotlight came on in the middle of the craft between the two red panels and I was entirely encased in a green mist that felt hot to my skin. I immediately felt a sexually charged sensation in my balls as well as the base of my spine that began to surge through my entire body. It was like an all consuming orgasm of heated energy pulsating my every fibre. As I seemed to climax, I felt myself lifting or levitating towards the ship. It wasn&apos;t like I was being pulled, as much as I was being energized to a float on my own - like my molecules were being manipulated by an internally-produced, stimulating force. The last thing I saw at this point was looking down on my friends still talking manically amongst themselves as I floated upward.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

At that time I noticed a formation of bright, orange balls that seemed to be roughly in the shape of a diagonal line.  (approximately two-o&apos;clock on a clock).  I say roughly because one ball appeared to be out of the line and further ahead.  I initially thought it was a military craft formation of some sort moving from the southeast, however as they got closer, it became apparent that this was not something mechanical.  There was absoulely no noise at all, and no trails of smoke or vapor were behind them.  They were located not too far above the horizon (meaning I did not have to look too far up to see them).  They appeared to be moving rapidly to the west and the pattern they were moving in changed as they moved.  There did not appear to be grouped in any shape now as they were moving.  Right before they disappeared, they clustered up together in two ci! rcles and then started winking out one by one.   The entire occurrene took less than two minutes, and it scared the heck out of my ten year old.  Most definitely not anything I have ever seen, and we have seen plenty of military crafts and manuevers in our area over the years.  They were not large in relation to the size of the moon, however they were much larger than stars and as I said much lower in the horizon.",

We were listening to my transistor radio; it was after midnight and the guys were inside the cottage.  We had consumed no alcohol or drugs and were just enjoying the cool, rather misty night, and each other&apos;s company.  We worked together at an advertising agency during the week, at Yonge Street &amp; Eglinton Avenue East in Toronto.All of a sudden, we heard a very faint whirring sound behind us overhead, and both looked up above the cottage roof where it originated from, at the same time.  What we saw there was this...a large, silver object which appeared perfectly round, beaming some kind of light on us.  Our jaws dropped, and we simply sat there frozen, stunned and terrified for a few seconds, which was how long it took me to receive a silent communication which was,&quot;you&apos;re afraid&quot;.  Then, the object took off upward, resembling what I could very loosely compare to the Roadrunner in the old cartoons when he was under chase, said &quot;beep beep&quot;, and ended up way beyond the mountains on the horizon in a matter of seconds.  Only now it was who-knows-how-many-miles directly above our heads (this was probably what is known as a &quot;hyperspace&quot; move); it then did a slow rectangular trajectory, then disappeared behind a cloud.  Perhaps it joined with something else, because what we witnessed next, through the clouds w! as a huge mass of light moving up, up and away into the northeastern sky.I lay awake that night, half-expecting &quot;little green men&quot; to come knocking at the door.  Our husbands were kind of in disbelief at our shared experience, I guess you can&apos;t blame them, but we saw what we saw, and looking back, I now consider myself extremely lucky and perhaps even chosen to have had them come and observe my friend and I that night ... it was definitely the highlight of my life.I would love to hear from others who have had sightings!

20100510,20100510," Knowlton, NJ", light,40 minutes,"~A close friend and I were outside smoking  cigarettes when a bright object in the sky caught our attention.  This was at approximately 20:50 EST.  The object appeared to be just a very bright star at first-- which was what caught our attention.  It was later determined to be moving, however, after a closer study.~A few points to supplement this assertion are: 1) object was eclipsed momentarily by tree limbs at several points and but would always return to open sky, as perceived from our position in front of my house.2) it flickered as it moved back and forth along the horizon and in circular or arc-shaped, sweeping motions to and fro.3) the object&apos;s light would dim after it reached the peak of its arc-maneuver and hence begin to move in the opposite direction, and would brighten considerably when facing us. the path of the light&apos;s beam could be seen when facing from side to side.4) once in awhile, the light would juke every which way and at odd combinations of sharp angles, in short bursts of incredible speed.~It at first seemed to be hovering over one point but we found the object to be maneuvering away from our position, as it eventually disappeared over the horizon. We were both compelled by strange, anxious feelings for the duration of the sighting.~ We repeatedly had to back up to keep the object in our view and actually had to move to my second-story balcony for the last ten minutes of the event, as if hypnotized to stare at this weird light until it could no longer be viewed. This was at approximately 21:19.~ I attempted to signal the object with a MAG-light-- in numeric combinations of numbers counting down from three-- but to no avail.  At one point, I attempted to use the 75-watt bulbs in the balcony lights as well. But still, the object retreated.~I judged the object to be three miles away at first and it was gone forty minutes later, still moving  in the direction of the Delaware Water Gap. This thing was very bright and very noticeable; I would find it hard to believe that nobody else saw it besides the two of us.~ All distance estimates were provided by the author of this report, who has worked in fields of occupation involving great heights and distances.",

I noticed a plane flying behind it but at a much lower altitude and way slower. It was a solid light not blinking like a plane and it was moving sporadically side to side up and down not drastically but similar to what a plane would look like in turbulent sky&apos;s.  The light was too high and too bright to be a plane.  I followed the light for about 30-40 seconds then it got dimmer and dimmer even though it did not change its altitude or speed than at about the minute mark it just disappeared into the stars.

We suspect that he is a superlative witness, and reporter of fact.  PD))The flight pattern of the five reddish orange lights were west or northwest at about a 20 to 30 degree angle.I would like to start this &quot;reported sighting&quot; letter with the statement, I, or we, my 12 year old son and I, aren&apos;t looking for any special status or &quot;pats-on-the-back&quot; for what we viewed.  Nor do we want to be thought of as, &quot;out of our minds&quot; for saying anything at all.  We simply saw what we saw, and just want to report it.To add a little validity to our report our backgrounds are:  My son - 12 going on 13 real soon, an &quot;A-&quot; student,  7th grade, athletic, only child at home.Myself - Retired Air Force, aviation was my career for 22+ years, aircraft mechanic 6 years, aircrew member, flight engineer, cargo and air refueling aircraft the last 16 years.  I worked in the airline/aviation industry for seven years after retirement from the Air Force.  I did finish college a few years after I retired.  Aviation Management with a minor in Aviation Safety; took a few courses in accident investigation which taught a person how to question and evaluate an &quot;eye witness&quot; to an event.The sighting took place on the night of May 10th, 2010 at approximately 21:40, (9:40 pm) PST.  We were outside enjoying a wood fire in a small mobile home park in Trinidad, CA.  A clear night, the rains had just gone through earlier in the day.  There is a small airport just south of our location about 11 miles away.My son and I were engaged in a conversation when I noticed a brighter than normal light coming up over the tree line just to the north of us.  I wouldn&apos;t have paid much attention to it had it not been so bright.  Initially, I thought it was a late night commuter flight arriving out of the north, but then I noticed it wasn&apos;t the normal color patterns of an aircraft, the green and red lights from the wing tips and the flashing anti-collision lights the FAA requires. The light pattern we saw was a reddish orange color, maybe a little yellow mixed in.  And they weren&apos;t flashing.  The colors were &quot;glowing&quot; or slowly pulsating.  I questioned then whether it was an aircraft or one that I knew of anyhow.  Granted, I&apos;ve been out of the aviation field going on seven years now.  I then noticed its movement.It was moving a little quicker than the normal &quot;prop&quot; or small jet type aircraft that come into our local airport.  And, it didn&apos;t appear to be one of the Coast Guards&apos; rescue helicopters out on a night flight.  All aircraft have a distinctive sound to them; there wasn&apos;t any sound at all coming from the sky.  Just the occasional car or truck going down Hwy 101 and the rustling of the redwood trees from a slight wind.  But then I figured it was too far away to hear.  However, that would mean it was a large craft with the size they were and not being able to hear them.  A couple of weeks ago, someone said that was Venus in the night sky that was so bright.  I just noticed it was a very bright star or planet on a clear night.  Compared to that, this light was at least twice the size.We watched it for about 30 seconds or so, maybe a minute.  It was traveling from our right to left which would be north to west or northwest direction.  It was then we both noticed two more similar lights appearing from the same location over the tree line.  Then a fourth one appeared following the two in front.  All seemed to be going in the same direction.  A tall redwood tree obstructed our view as we watched and I had my son move to his left to try and pick them up as they appeared from behind the tree.  They never reappeared.  He said,&quot; Papa, they disappeared!&quot;  About that time and I would say again it was around 30 seconds or so, a fifth light appeared, trailing all the others and moving in the same direction.  We then moved our position to be able to watch the craft without obstructions from tall trees.  We kept an eye on it and to our amazement, it all of a sudden got smaller and disappeared.  Wow! is all we could say.The direction of the flight pattern for the five reddish orange lights were west or northwest at about a 20 to 30 degree angle in the sky as referenced from the top of the tree line to the point where the last one disappeared.  It all took place within a three to four minute time period I would guess, but I wasn&apos;t keeping track of the time while watching.  I did happen to remember to ask my son what time it was when the last &quot;light&quot; disappeared.I could only hope that others saw this and are reporting it.  As a military flight crew member I could only describe a few of the &quot;odd&quot; things I saw throughout my flying career as, well, &quot;odd.&quot;  Now, at least in my mind, I have some creditable proof to maybe I wasn&apos;t seeing things.....",

This aircraft was larger than any plane I have ever seen and was flying low and did not make any sound.  I believe that if it were a plane, perhaps it was a stealth bomber, but it is likely that even if it were a stealth bomber flying that low it would have had to make some noise.

I do know that it was in 1995, I believe in the summertime. Myself and a friend (both about 16 yrs of age) witnessed it from my mother&apos;s home in Longbranch, WA.  I have checked on and off for years to see if I could find any similar reports occurred in the same area around the same timeframe and have been unable to find any to date.  I recently found the website for NUFORC, so I thought I would give a shot at reporting it here to see if I could get any further information.  I have to admit that in a way the following description will sound like something you might read or see in a sci-fi story, but I can assure that I and my friend witnessed the event as I will describe in the text below firsthand with the exception of the details from the following morning which were relayed to me by my mother, which seem to bear relevance to the situation so I will include that as well.At some point late night or early morning, I will say around midnight would be a fair estimate, the two of us were sitting in my room.  I looked through my window and saw a bright light through the branches of a tree outside which at first I took to be just a bright star in the night sky.  Within the next several minutes I looked out again and the light was still there in the same position but seemed a little brighter.  Again a few minutes passed and I looked out again, but at this time I could see that the light was in another position relative to the tree, so at this time I mentioned it to my friend and we decided to watch it through the window as the position changed seemed unusual.  Again it stayed in this position for a couple minutes while we watched and then suddenly disappeared and reappeared almost instantly at yet a new point. At this juncture we decided to go outside to watch as it seemed to be getting closer and would soon be at a point where we could not easily see it above from the window.  Outside we watched for several more minutes with the same process repeating where the object would be stationary in the sky, disappear, and then reappear at another point.  I would say this went on for what seemed to be at least 20 to 30 minutes.  If I recall the directions correctly the object was north of us to begin with when I first saw it and progressively moved south toward us as it went (I will continue to use this directional assumption for the duration of this account).At this time from the southeast we heard the sound of jets approaching from the direction of McChord Air Force Base which is located in Tacoma, which is the nearest large city to Longbranch.  We located them in the sky and saw multiple jets moving in the direction of the light.  When they appeared to be nearing it, it moved to a new point in the same manner as before and the jets turned and went toward it again.  This repeated several times with the same results over several more minutes. More jets approached and this continued with the object now moving further into the east.  They progressively moved out further over the surrounding woods in that direction  until we could no longer see them over the trees.  I would estimate this cat and mouse between them to have gone on for at least 15 to 20 minutes before we lost sight of them all with an estimate of around maybe 8 to 10 jets participating overall.  We watched a few more minutes to be sure they didn&apos;t come back in our directio! n and then saw a large dark object coming just over the trees from the same direction the jets and object disappeared from, passing directly over our heads.  When it got near and passed above us it clearly appeared to be a large black helicopter running with no visible lights and with no discernible sound from the rotors.  This is the end of what we saw firsthand.The next morning my mother returned from a trip she had taken to visit family in the Tacoma area the day before and when she got home she asked if anything unusual had happened the night before.  When I asked why she was asking she stated that when she was passing through Longbranch on the way to our home that there were multiple government-plated cars parked by the road with men in suits stopping any passersby to ask if they had seen or heard anything going on the previous night, without giving any information into the nature of their inquiry.  I informed her of what I&apos;d seen but we agreed to keep the information to ourselves at that time.  We never heard or saw anything further on it.  As stated previously, the last part involving my mother was not first-hand, but it does seem pertinent to the prior night&apos;s event, although she passed away a few years ago and is no longer around to verify that particular aspect.If you have taken the time to read this in total without discounting it offhand, I appreciate your time and apologize for the length of it, although I did feel I should be as detailed and thorough as possible.  I hope to find out through this outlet if anyone else has seen or heard anything about what happened here, but if not I shall continue to search on my own in the future as I would like to know what occurred here.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

I observed the UFOs first at about 2200, and saw two through trees.  I knew they were far away based on how fast I was moving and how the objects remained still as the trees obscuring my view of them zoomed past me as I drove by them. I saw two first.  They appeared as oval shaped amber lights.  My view of them vanished as houses obscured my view of them. I then proceeded with a patrol for work, then moved to another location.At this location about 8 miles North of the first, I again saw them; about 30 minutes after the first sighting.  This time I saw 8 or more of these large lights. The first illuminated, about 3/4 the size of the full moon in the sky.  Then many more appeared to the left, and in a sort-of strobe like way the lights on the right went out and ones to the left came on.  They also zoomed around (though never moved far) they were not stationary.I pointed it out to some residents in a pool of the community I was at.  Only one of them locked eyes on it and only saw the tail end of it.  I told them to keep their eyes open in that direction.The event occurred South of my position in Chandler, AZ.  It is possible they were South of Queen Creek and Mericopa, two nearby cities.",

20100512,20100512," Portland, OR", light,30 minutes +/-,"On the morning of Wednesday April 28, I was staying at a friend&apos;s house in SW portland and we had been up all night having a conversation.  We were standing in his kitchen looking out the sliding glass door to the upper balcony.  His deck looks east over the Willamette, and his house sits very high up, near John&apos;s Landing and Macadam.  Because his house sits at the top of the viewpoint it offers a full view of Ross Island and directly parallel from the deck is the north end of Oaks Bottom Natural Reservation.  This is where the whole incident took place it did not happen in the sky. The objects appeared about a half mile away from us, from the opposite bank, the east side, of the river.Before we noticed the lights, we were having a good conversation talking about the state of the world, spirituality, and sharing personal experiences.  I had gotten to the subject of recent UFO sighting I&apos;ve had, and I was explaining to him that I really feel that we can be making efforts to reach out and contact off world visitors, as individuals, and as communities or small groups.  I was telling him about a sighting I had near Lake Cushman in Washington, where I was staying at a friends cabin.  This particular sighting happened one night a few months prior, when I went out to the deck of the cabin overlooking the lake.  Strangely enough, when I went out there the sky was clear but nothing unusual was visible.  I closed my eyes and began to envision a light rising up out of the lake, and I put out my thoughts that I wish to have a contact and I want to see something, then when I opened my eyes out in the distance on one of the hills was a white light which had appeared while my! eyes were closed! It pulsed irregularly with no apparent pattern, and the brightness of the pulses also were changing.  This is a sighting in Washington months ago so I won&apos;t go into detail here.  But it&apos;s important to describe this because it is interconnected with all of my sightings I&apos;ve had recently, which all seem to be the same &apos;type of craft&apos;.SO, while I was describing this to my friend, I had been looking out his window at lights which were flashing and changing colors, but I hadn&apos;t noticed consciously.  My friend interrupted me from my descriptions and said, &quot;What are those lights out there?&quot;  I then noticed we were looking at something unusual.  I started to list things off and I thought at first we were looking at a traffic intersection, was there an accident?  Were we looking at ambulance lights or was there construction going on out there?  But my friend pointed out the lights were not coming from our side of the river, they weren&apos;t that close.  These lights were coming from across the river!  We went out to the balcony and our eyes adjusted to the darkness, it was just before sun rise so it was pretty dark out.  We could clearly see the outline of the river and Ross Island, and the tree line and bank of the east side where Oaks Bottom sits.The lights were all very close together, I would say there was an area of 100-200 feet which these lights stuck together and hovered around very close to ground level.  The lights didn&apos;t rise up above the tree line so they stayed about 50-100 feet above the ground and the river.  They moved slightly at first from side to side, and then towards the end of the sighting they did move north about a quarter mile before disappearing right before our eyes.To describe the lights without seeing them for yourself does not give justice to the intensity of what we saw! I could not stop saying, &quot;This is so beautiful! Have you ever seen something so amazing and beautiful before!&quot;  I was touched by the sheer sight of it all.  But also I was going through phases of many emotions and physical feelings during this sighting.  At first I was skeptical, uncertain of the area we were viewing, that it could be something unexplainable.  But as it got brighter out I could see my friend was right, it was an area where there are no buildings, no roads, and no public access.  The lights we saw are unlike anything I&apos;ve really seen before.  Even in science fiction movies, these lights just were so unique I can&apos;t really describe it perfectly.There were lots of colors, and the lights seemed to change rapidly in shape, size, color, and brightness. The lights would stay &apos;lit&apos; for a split-second to a full few seconds.  And the lights were not lights on an object - this is very important to understand - the UFO was a group of lights with no other objects associated.  I could clearly see, for the entire duration, the larger lights would pulsate, glow, and vibrate for a few seconds.  Then, upon shrinking and disappearing, it would be followed by dozens of colorful sparkles and twinkles and yet more bright white-blue or golden pulses.  The number of individual pulses and appearances would number in the hundreds.  Because for the whole duration these twinkling pulsating orbs of light would be constantly changing and it was hard to say whether we were observing a collective of dozens of individual objects, or if this was some kind of vortex which many objects were popping in and out of, or if maybe it was all one big transparent object which dozens of changing lights appearing all over it.We were out there for a while and continued to watch these lights with much excitement and wonder, for the next 20-30 minutes I assume.  The sun came up not long after we stepped outside, and the lights continued pulsing even though it was then light out and we could clearly see no vehicles, people, objects, or anything at all! The lights were appearing from out of nowhere, they were literally phasing into our visual perception either from another dimension, or from a band of light or vibration which we cannot visually see - or both.I recall my friend describing that he felt very warm through the entire experience, I too did feel like I was having hot-flashes, but I at the peak of the experience, I felt as if electricity was surging through my body, and I felt like I was having a transmission of thought with these objects. So many feelings went through me. But not one tiny amount of fear was felt - I felt completely secure and in fact I felt very blissful and loving energy. I recall that there were tears streaming down my cheeks and I couldn&apos;t help but cry because the love and joy I was feeling was SO intense!  I felt that these lights were supporting us, all of humanity, and they care dearly for our well-being and our planet too. We are not alone and we live in a vast universe. But we do not have anything to fear, if we feel fear and are in a negative place within, then we are going to attract such experiences perhaps unconsciously. We must remain grounded, centered, and composed.We didn&apos;t get any pictures or footage at all unfortunately, but this sighting was more than a usual UFO sighting, to me it was a CE5 - a close encounter of the fifth kind characterized by close bilateral communication, and experiencing physical effects from the encounter. I can send a picture of where the sighting took place using an aerial of the area from google maps - if this is something that would be useful then let me know.I can be contacted via phone or e-mail for further questions and details.  I am an artist so I have been drawing what I saw but truly the whole incident was so dynamic a simple picture doesn&apos;t really show the incredible animation of these objects.I am personally making efforts to pursue more contacts and I feel very confident now that things are just beginning and I am very excited for the near future events to come.  I know I have my own personal perception of what happened and because i&apos;ve experienced &apos;supernatural&apos; or unusual events all my life, I am very confident in trusting my intuition on these matters.  Contact with these higher dimensional beings requires an open heart, and pure intent.  We must be raising our vibration as individuals, communities, and a planet - there is much hope for us here in our quest to heal and clean our home, these beings are here for multiple reasons, some may be a part of our earth too, some may be here to assist us or our planets or the sun. We will find out more as we open up and begin to shift into the new paradigm.There is much more I could attribute to this sighting, as in the last 2 weeks I&apos;ve had yet another sighting but of a smaller implication. I&apos;ve seen ufos in the sky but my sightings are happening on ground level as well simultaneously in some cases. I am pursuing more contacts with an open heart and mind. Thought and meditation techniques are very helpful and I believe the way to go for pursuing a communication with dimensional beings. Please contact me if you feel compelled to, I feel there is much more to come very soon!",

It was slowly moving higher in the sky from the north and moving west to east.

Object was a self-luminous body, grey-blue-white, not very bright, about like the moon behind thick clouds, and was retangular, with no lights whatsoever.  No sound at all.  The backyard is quiet, and it flew directly overhead.  It was about twice as long as wide (2:1), and took, I guess, between 8 and 11 seconds to traverse from 30 deg above my right horizon (about 800 - 1200 feet high?) to my left horizon and disappear.  There was no wind at all.  This was not a bird or balloon.  It was hauling straight line, overhead.  I was very careful to make mental notes as I observed, trying to see any extensions beyond the rectangular shape, but could not see anything more.  Honestly, it did appear to change its shape after it passed overhead and was halfway between me, and the point on the horizon where it disappeard... into almost a birdlike shape for an instance, and then changed back, then disappear.  The size was a one inch object held 12 inches from your eyes.",

I posted the second time that was on April 28, but do not see that is has been posted to this site as of  5/13/10.We were, once again, at her mailbox when we caught site of it again-in about the same place as the first and second time.  I turned off the headlights and kept on the parking lights to try to sneak up on it; but had to turn the lights back on pretty soon.  This time the lights were white and small like they started out that first time we saw it, but this time we noticed that there were small yellow flashing lights on the outside of each white light.  As we approached the thing, it started to immediately back away and the lights got bigger.  The closer we got, the faster it went.  We kept visual with it as it went into the air and went ahead of us down the farm road.  When it got to my daughter&rsquo;s house, it was behind some trees; we could still see the two lights.  I tried to get a picture, but couldn&rsquo;t get the object clearly in the view finder of my cell phone.I left my daughter, after being sure she was inside and the door was locked.As I was going out, I looked in my rearview mirror and the two lights were right behind me!!  Man did I take off!!  It was still behind me when I got to the end of the road near the mailboxes, So I stopped. When I stopped, it stropped maybe was 30 feet from me.  I took a picture, but in my excitement, forgot to press the save button!.Whatever this thing is, it likes where it is since we have seen it three times now.  We are realizing that if it wanted to hurt us, it had every opportunity to do so.   I even stopped half way down the road and stood up in the car and out of the top sunroof -cell phone it hand to try to see it and get a picture-lights off, of course, but kept the motor running for a fast exit, if necessary.The second time we saw it, it took off in a great big hurry since it was a moonlite night.

I guess I must have been between 10 and 15 years young back then. I am now 32 years of age.Ok, this story has been nagging me for many years, as I have never been completely sure if I have only been dreaming or if it has been real, that is why I have not really told anyone.One night I woke up in the middle of the night, and I got up to go into the kitchen to get myself some fresh water to drink from the sink in the kitchen on the second floor of our house.  I hopped on the kitchen table that was beside the big kitchen window in order to get a better view out of the window.  I had a habit of watching the stars out of that particular window quite frequently when beeing dark outside.So I gazed at the stars when I started to see some lights rising on the horizon of our small mountainous terrain here.  The lights quickly grew to light-spheres while coming down from the top of the little mountain that was straight ahead of the window.  They were moving in a straight decending line directly towards our house, keeping rather near to the ground at all times and very very fast.  So fast that for a moment I even feared they would crush into our house.  In a splitsecond they stopped dead ahead of the kitchen window at only a few, maybe 3 to 5 meters away.  The whole travel could not have lasted more then 3-4 seconds in total.  I just checked from Google Earth that the top of the mountain is approx. 500m bird-line from our house, high-differential of maybe 100 meters.Now I could see the orbs / spheres very clearly.  There were maybe 5-7 of them, each one kind of translucient, still radiating a quite strong light.  Each one in a different color: blue, orange, red, purple, yellow, almost like a rainbow.  The colored light seemed the come from the spheres outer shell only, beeing unevenly distributed.  Kind of like the soap-bubbles having this kind of oily, uneven texture.  The texture now only beeing unevenly distrubuted patters of light.  The spheres must have been about 1/2 to 1 meter in diameter.For a few seconds the spheres where hovering still before my window.  Then they started to move again, spinning around our house, light sipping in from the different windows in the different rooms.  That got me freaking out and I started to panic, as I realized that I was alone at home that night, my parents beeing on some of their parties.  I think i started screaming, running around eratically around the house (of that I am sure). I was really really scared and I don&apos;t remeber having any clear thought in that moments.Weird thing is, I do not know how it ended.  That is why I was always struggling with myself, pondering wether it was only a dream or something real.  And I still am. I was wondering if there is anyone out there, having experienced something similar.Although having a strong interest in the matter of UFO, I try to remain sceptic. To this very day I have not seen anyting that has convinced me of UFO&apos;s or e.g. dimensional things beeing real.For the above stated reason I will give permission to release my contact info. At this stage I will only hand out a synonym (+email), not my real name of course.",

It was dark due to overcast, so there were no stars in sight.I was tracing the outline of a pine tree in her yard against the dark sky, and noticed at first what I thought to be a star, behind a branch of this tree.  I noticed it as the wind caused it&apos;s branches to sway, revealing this object.Then this &quot;star&quot; began to slowly move out from behind this tree.  It was an orange-gold in color and spherical, much like a star would be, but it shone much, much brighter.  Also, it&apos;s movements were rather peculiar - it&apos;s rate of motion wasn&apos;t necessarily fast, but it definitely did NOT move at a constant rate.  It would move across the sky slowly, then speed up slightly, then slow again, almost like it was floating or dancing.  Also, it did not move in straight lines, it would wobble almost, and sway slightly as it moved.I watched this object move around the sky in this strange fashion for about a minute, when I realized I should wake my sleeping girlfriend to show her too.  I woke her, and then we watched for about another minute.  Then, it slipped back behind the tree, and I struggled to follow it through the branches.  A jet or a plane then came into sight as it flew across the sky, and I knew it was a jet or plane due to the strobe lights on it, and its steady rate of movement across the sky.  It also flew out of sight behind this large tree, into the same vicinity as the object.I watched this tree closely, the jet passed out on the other side of it, but the object in question never re-emerged from behind it and vanished.",

My husband had died 4 months before.It was the 4th of July, 1973.  The young boys wanted to sleep so I slept out with them on the front lawn of our country home.  We had fun looking at the stars and we were tired.  The boys fell asleep but I couldn&rsquo;t, because I was thinking of their Dad and wishing he was here with us.  I did things like this with them hoping it would help them to not be so sad.As I lay there I looked up and saw a large &quot;fireball&quot; floating over the trees and continued over the house, coming from south to north.  After it passed over another one came from the same direction but slightly off the same path but also going in the same direction.  And as soon as it passed was over my shoulder I saw a 3rd one came over.  Their color was orangy-red and looked on fire and they were complete silent.  No noise at all..  It took about 10 seconds for each one of them to pass overhead until the next one came.  I was so shocked that I didn&rsquo;t turn around to see how long it took them to go out of sight.Also, I tried to compare their size with the moon.  Comparing the almost full moon in the sky to the fireballs they were three-fourths as big as the moon.  It&rsquo;s really hard to tell how high or low they were.

As I headed back into my house, I noticed an extremely bright light in the sky behind my house.  I was immediately struck by the brightness of the object because it had just turned dark.  I observed it for a moment or two, wondering if it was a planet.  When I realized that there were no other stars in the sky yet, I became more intrigued.  I, therefore, decided to observe it longer.  5 minutes turned into 10 minutes, and I called my husband outside to ask him what he thought it was.  He first thought it was a planet or the &quot;north star,&quot; but as he observed it longer, he thought it was &quot;a little strange.&quot;  The light was not moving and made absolutely no sound. After approximately 10 minutes, my husband decided to go back into the house.  I, however, remained transfixed, and continued my observation for approximately 30-40 minutes longer before I decided to go ba! ck into my house to get my camera.  At approximately 9:15-20 p.m., I took photos of the light.  During the entire 40-45 minutes of my constant observation of this light, it remained in relatively the same spot in the sky.  [It is important to note that we live less than one mile away from the Mercer County Airport and literally see planes landing on the runway (running west to east) through the trees in our backyard. This light, however, was directly north, and during my observation of this light, continued to see planes fly in front of it.]   As I began to take pictures of the light (which visually remained static) I noticed that when I found it in my camera viewfinder the object appeared to be MOVING very rapidly in a haphazard way.  When I moved my eyes away from the camera to observe the light, it appeared perfectly still to my eyes! I took 8 pictures of the light on May 15th.  After I took my 8 pictures, the light simply disappeared. During my observation of the light, I was ! not frightened, simply intrigued and highly curious about what! I was o bserving.  It is also important to note that I was seeking some confirmation that it might be an airplane flying south, however, at no time did I observe flashing beacon lights.The light appeared again in the same relative spot in the sky on Sunday, June 6th, 2010 at approximately 8:00 p.m.  My husband and I were returning home and I noticed the same very bright light as I got out of our car.  It was earlier than the previous 5/15/10 sighting, and the sky was somewhat lighter.  Again, there were no other observable stars yet in the sky, thereby highlighting the intensity and oddness of this particular light.  I immediately retrieved my camera and took 7 pictures of the light. I observed the light intermittently (i.e., I kept coming outside from the house to check on it rather than strictly observing it as I did on 5/15) for approximately 40 to 50 minutes.  Just as in the first sighting, the light remained static (to my eye) and remained in the same relative position in the sky. The final time I checked, it was gone (approximately 9:00 p.m. or so.)   Since my two sightings of this intense light (and subsequent review of my pictures), I am HIGHLY curious about it and am hoping that someone can explain what it is to me.  I now find myself looking for the light every night, but have not seen it since the 6/6/10 sighting.  Further, I did check the flight data on the ISS, and it was nowhere near my position in New Jersey on either 5/15/10 or 6/6/10.((NUFORC Note:  If in the NW sky, probably Venus.  PD))",

Air flight headed to Greene Airport in Warwick...I am on the flight line for flights coming from the S.W. and South).  As the passenger jet, flew over at about a thousand feet, I looked to the left a bit to see a small gray cylinder perfectly stationary, at a higher altitude than the jet...I said to myself, &quot;What the heck is that?&quot;   The sky was very clear and blue with excellent visibility.  As I looked at the cylinder for a few seconds it started to move Northerly at increasing speed, while at the same time going from gray to white and then to opaque and then to invisible.  I had the feeling that it knew I was watching it.  I kept watching that area of the sky when I saw a dark bird-like gliding craft come from the S.W., at about the same altitude as the cylinder...it had wings, was blackish, and glided like a bird, but was not a bird.  I went inside! to get my binoculars but when I came out it was gone.  The only noise heard was from the passenger jet.  Back on January 20 and 21st of this year our area of southern Rhode Island was subjected to low flying odd jet-like craft (see my report for those dates).

Frozen in fear, I looked up at the sky, seconds after the illumination began, and witnessed only what appeared to be a white burning horizontal column moving across the sky, appearing to be very high in altitude, and casting off white embers.  There was no sound, nor detectable smells, and the white column appeared to &quot;burn out,&quot; in any event going away with the illumination receding.

I ran a service company that cleaned commercial heating and air conditioning systems. This sighting happened just outside of Altivista va. on state rd. 29 heading north.  Myself and one employee were traveling home after work this particular night at about 11:00pm when i noticed a very bright light up ahead just above the highway.  At first when i mentioned this to my work partner, he laughed and did not pay much attention to this object, but i was watching closely. As i began to get closer to this object i realized that it was no air craft.  This object was a large black colored trangle with three huge barrels under the bottom that emitted light from each of them.  The light glowed brightly and then it faded out to a dull glow under each barrel, and it did this several times as we were still approaching the object.By this time we were almost directly under the object in my work van.  I pulled over to the side of the road so we could continue to observe this object.  My work partner was at this point, very afraid of what he was seeing and i admitt i was not feeling comfortable with this sighting because it was so close to us and we were the only ones on the highway during this sighting. This object was totally silent as it hovered above us. This object was just above tree top level which was about sixty feet up.As we were sitting there on the side of the road looking up at the object it began to slowly move to the right side a little further closer to the trees and then we noticed that the object was gone, but we did not see it vanish or move one direction or the other at that point.  Strangely enough, we both had a feeling of missing time or something i just have no way of explaining, but thats how it was.  My work partner, who is now a long time friend as well, was a serious skeptic about such things as u.f.o.s until this experience.  I had told him about the disc i saw back in 1996 over the s! ears bui lding, but he never believed me until this experience happened to him.  To this day i still get a laugh out of what he siad while we were driving home that night after we saw the object.

The object had multi colored lights not flashing on and off more that they were dimming and getting brighter and possibly looked as if they were rotating around the object.  We also observed many planes being routed over us coming from Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport that we do not normally see.  We observed this object for about 45 minutes as it finally moved very slowly towards the west until we lost it on the horizon.  As planes moved towards the object there was a white light that would emanate from the object towards the approaching plane.  This beam of light was wide and was white and very dim not bright.  The object seemed to be shaped to where it had a vertical section to a point and a larger mass at its center where most of the lights were at.  The object was in the direction of Luke AFB from our position.,

This &quot;object,&quot; from my point of observation, was moving at a very slow pace. The light and trail so faint, barely visible to plain eye.From the North, a white/blue light was shooting across the sky in a jagged flying pattern. Sometimes the light would disappear for a second, reappear above the moon, disappear again and reappear moments later in a position below the moon.. all the while heading South until disappearing behind the landscape.By this time I had entered the &quot;Phoenix Bypass Route&quot; which is where the I-8 meets up with 85 North heading back up to I-10 W. It was just before 8:55 pm.. I just made the switch onto the 85 North.What looked like a flare being &quot;shot out of&quot; Venus, and also at a 45 degree angle, started gaining acceleration towards the ground. As the &quot;flare&quot; flew closer to the earth, it appeared to change in color.. ranging from bright white.. to pinks and finally a white-blue. This streak of light.. or this &quot;fireball,&quot; also appeared to be growing larger and brighter as approaching the ground.I remember feeling like I was about to see a spacecraft crash into a field just to the north of me. I remember preparing myself for the &quot;impact.&quot; Before the object touched down, I stopped my truck short in the middle of the freeway and did a 180 degree turn, with the intentions of following the object for the rest of its voyage.Just before it hit the ground.. the object leveled out in a seamless motion, and it shot across the terrain... a white fireball (the light smaller now), and in a &quot;zipping&quot; like motion, this object hovered and glided gracefully above the ground before disappearing behind some nearby desert terrain.I also realize I was near an airport, but this was not a plane.",

While co-piloting a 1959 B-95 Beechcraft &quot;Travel Air&quot; between Mesa falcon field (KFFZ) and St. George Utah (KSGU) I witnessed along with two others a spherical craft within approximately one statute mile of our position.  While making a course correction turn over the &quot;drake&quot; VOR at 150 knots 8500ft climbing to 10,500 approx heading 330 degrees(Prescott, AZ, according to GPS right after the event our exact posistion was 17 miles due east from the Prescott airport.)  I was visually scanning the sky for other air traffic prior and during a left turn. Looking upward (off the starboard wing as it banked upward) the object in question came into veiw. It was a silver lenticular disk, I was the first witness to spot the object.  The passenger seated directly behind me was the second.  I asked the passenger to look up while still in the turn and to simply tell me what they saw.  The witness stated &quot;Oh my god... It&apos;s a flying saucer!&quot; (or somthing to that ! effect) By this time I had turned passed my intended heading.  I made a corrective turn passed the course in the opposite direction so I could see it again in another left hand turn.  We reaquired the target and attempted to photograph the object with a cell phone camera, without success.  It is difficult to judge it&apos;s exact size, however if it was anything close to a convetional aircraft in size it was within 1 to 2 miles almost directly above our aircraft.  As we continued our zig zag turns (in order to maintain a visual contact) on or about or third turn cycle the object began to climb in a spiralling arc through a broken cloud layer that was at about 12,500 plus feet at a very high rate (I estimated 500 to 700 knots possibly supersonic, I based this on my experience as a pilot and witnessing many supersonic fighter aircraft)  No condensation trail, and no visable exhaust trail and was out of visual range in under 8 seconds or so.

20100517,20100517," Donnelly, ID", unknown,1/2 hour,"When there is an animal mutilation, what can you hear?I believe it is the time to make this report. When it comes to animal mutilations, usually cows and occasionally horses, seemingly it &quot;just happens&quot; with no witnesses.  Some say black helicopters are in the area, but I think they were chasing what actually did the job.  A helicopter does not fit my understanding of the event.  Although I was not a direct witness, I was too close. Here is my story. On Thursday night, August 29, 1991, my late wife and I were camping on Kennally Creek, six miles east of Donnelly, Idaho.  That night at 3AM there was a wild ruckus of coyotes barking.  It woke us up and our attention was on those coyotes wondering why this was happening.  It seemed like all the coyotes in the whole valley were concentrated just to the south of where we were camping. Imagine a hundred coyotes in one place barking and baying.  Then total silence.  By total silence I mean that nothing could be heard.  We were next to a stream and could not hear the stream gurgling. Many know the wonderful sounds that a stream can make to lure you into dreamland when camping.  However, this night, at this moment not even the stream could be heard.Suddenly, there was a screaming-screeching sound of great volume that lasted more than a minute. There was silence again, that same total silence defeating even the natural sounds of the forest and the stream. This time the silence lasted for about five minutes. Suddenly, that same loud noise, the intense lasting screaming sound could be heard once again, and after it was over, the coyotes were barking once again. We were listening to the coyotes in some degree of fear trying to figure out what was happening and then, oddly, we both fell fast asleep.We woke up together at 9AM, discussed the strangeness of the night and decided to pack up and go back home. About a week later we invited my parents to join us on a camping trip and returned to the same place. This location by Kennally Creek had been a family favorite since about 1956. In those forty years very little had changed at the campsite. Not even the tiny pond where my sister and I played with frogs and garter snakes has changed, and where my grandchildren did the same.That night of the first day camping with my parents a local rancher showed up on horseback and told us the story of how, just over a ridge a week before, just 160 yards from our tent, was a horse mutilation. He detailed the usual findings of precision cuts, no tracks, and no blood. It happened on the same night we heard the coyotes and screaming sounds. Some may say we just heard a mountain lion scream; however, a mountain lion does live there, just a few hundred feet to the north and we have heard it scream, and there was no comparison; however, if you need the mountain lion connection, you would have to have several of them in one place and screaming in more than twice the volume as they can do.A little more about the location can be given. Using Google Earth &trade; you travel nearly due east of Donnelly, Idaho six miles. The coordinates for the mutilation are: 44&ordm; 42&apos; 41.53&quot;N, 115&ordm; 57&apos; 39.82W and the coordinates for the campsite are 44&ordm; 42&rsquo; 41.53&rdquo; N, 115&ordm; 57&rsquo; 33.39&rdquo; W.An old newspaper article can be found at Google Newspapers by pasting this address into your browser: http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19910906&amp;id=ZTsVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PwgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6538,3646572  From the camping spot, Kennally Creek empties into Gold Fork River at about 2 &frac12; miles south as the crow flies.

20100518,20100518," Saskatoon (Canada), SK", other,30 seconds,"Bulbous looking object seen moving through the skyI had stepped outside to sit in my back yard around 16:10 (4:10 p.m.) CST today for a brief rest after spending a long time working at my computer. I recently bought a pair of Nikon Sportstar 10 x 25 binoculars and so I thought I would pass some time looking at birds, clouds and aircraft. There were scattered light cumulus clouds in the vicinity, but most of the sky overhead was clear and brilliantly blue. There was also a lot of air traffic. I watched three Boeing 737s pass directly overhead, a few minutes apart, and a four-engine jet somewhat south of my location. The larger jet was too far and too high to identify, but the engines left pronounced contrails.  The 737s showed up very clearly in my binoculars, although there was a slight atmospheric haze, but I had them sharply in focus.At about 16:20 (4:20 p.m.), just after watching the last of the 737s pass over, I began lowering the binoculars toward the horizon, when another object appeared in the field of view. I thought I had happened upon a small aircraft, so I steadied the binoculars to follow the craft through the sky. At that point, I realized that it didn&rsquo;t look like an aircraft. It was filling a greater portion of my field of view than any of the jets had earlier. If it was a small aircraft, it should have been close enough to hear the engines, yet there were no aircraft sounds to be heard. If it was an aircraft, my view would have been about 45 degrees off its right front, with the aircraft banking in a right-hand turn, such that the wings would have been &ldquo;level&rdquo; with my point of view, but it was traveling perpendicular to my position, not turning toward me. For a second, I thought it was an aircraft similar to a de Havilland Tracker, with brightly painted engine nacelles. Then I thought it mig! ht be some kind of bird, first thinking that it must be soaring, because there was no motion of beating wings. But it didn&rsquo;t really look like a bird. The object consisted of two large red-orange spheres, separated by a distance that was somewhat less than the diameter of either sphere, with a white body or fuselage between them and also a white body or fuselage attached slightly below them. The white shape(s) could have been spherical, about the same size as the red-orange spheres. It was hard to make out the shape of the white part(s), i.e., whether it was one body or separate pieces. the red-orange spheres were very bright in the direct sunlight, almost as if they were lights, but I don&apos;t think they were illuminated.I followed the object with my binoculars as it continued a wide, steady, unwavering arc in a clockwise direction, until I lost it from sight as it passed behind my house. At that point, I got up from my chair to try to follow the object further, but I could not find it in the sky.Whatever the object was, it had to have been some distance away, as it was as sharply focused in my binoculars as the 737s had been. For that reason, I ruled out the possibility that it could have been an insect and most smaller species of birds. If it was a bird, it would have been very large. The largest birds we have around here are pelicans, and this certainly was no pelican. I thought it could be a cluster of party balloons, but it was moving contrary to the wind and on a very steady path. Also, it was apparent that it was some distance away, both because it was sharply focused in the binoculars and because of the atmospheric haze between the object and me. Party balloons would not have filled so much of the field of view at that kind of distance.Because I saw it for only a short time and was not able to see it by the naked eye, I really can&rsquo;t say for sure what I may or may not have seen. I&rsquo;m reporting this mainly in case someone else saw it and either can explain it or would like confirmation that they were not alone in seeing it.",

As I looked harder I noticed a dark line pointing up towards it at about a 45 degree angle.I kept my eye on it until it disappeared behind trees, due to the bends in the I-10.  About 7-10 minutes later we were approaching Intersection 196, Capital Circle NE, when we finally got a good look at what we&rsquo;d seen from a distance.There were two objects.  The first was a small, highly reflective, bullet shaped object with no wings or tail.  The second was rather more startling.  Keeping pace behind the bullet shaped object was &lsquo;V&rsquo; shaped object that was quite simply the biggest think  I&apos;ve ever seen in the sky.  Although a good distance away it was easily the size of a football stadium, possibly larger.  The object was dark gray/brown in color.My wife was quite shaken up by this.  I was excited!

The purpose of the visit was to borrow his video camera in the hopes that I&apos;d catch some of what I&apos;d seen the previous evening on video. I was leaving his house with the camera when I looked up North in the sky and saw something appear in the sky seemingly out of nowhere. I can&apos;t be certain how to describe its movement but it was similar to that of a jellyfish. After about 30 seconds a second one appeared. I hollered to matt who came out on his balcony and confirmed what I thought I was seeing. They began to move in a easterly direction. Sometimes appearing to drift and at other times they looked to be propelling themselves. It&rsquo;s important to note neither object drifted the same way as the wind or clouds. We watched them for about 15 minutes until they were out of sight. At that moment a plane that looked very similar to an airliner but painted all black or b! lue on the bottom swooped through from east to west at about 500 feet in altitude right where I had first seen the ufos. Then directly after the plane swooped through Matt began hollering to look directly up in the sky. Over head and very high we saw a number of lights blinking on and off and dancing around. This persisted for another half hour. Also I noticed cotton like substance falling from the sky. I collected some of the material and am hoping have it analyzed. It was very hard to catch these objects with the video camera I was using but I did capture one of them for a brief moment.((NUFORC Note:  One of three reports from the same source in Denver.

It disappeared and reappeared three times before I lost it.  Then 10 minutes later I noticed two more. One was travelling southeast and the other (which I estimate to be about 5 times the brightness of Venus was travelling northeast.

Furthermore there were no clouds in the sky.  At this point I dialed 911 just to have an official reporting.  Then as I was on the phone I saw a fourth one appear.  It looked to me like it was following an aircraft that I noticed was far out in front of the light (maybe a mile).

I left the kitchen and went to my living room and I still had that   pressure in my ears so I walked outside.

20100519,20100519," Grant, AL", teardrop,10-15 mins,"2 Teardrop shaped crafts sighted, one followed us down the mountainMy girlfriend and I left my mother&rsquo;s house around 10:20pm on Monday night. She lives on a mountain with lots of pasture and trees. We started driving down the mountain when we passed a car on a very big curve. There was a large break in the trees, and that is when we saw the UFO. It was approximately 400ft above the tree line and approximately 100ft in front of us. I was trying to make sure it was infact a UFO and not a plane, so I unconsciously started slowing down and stopped while we were staring and discussing its shape. It appeared to be rather stationary at that time. It had three bright lights we could clearly see, which seemed to give it a circular or teardrop shape. As we were talking it started moving more in our direction. It moved at an angle, getting closer to both the ground and our position simultaneously. At which point my girlfriend tells me I need to start driving again since she doesn&apos;t want to get abducted. It was like I was in a trance a! nd unable to move at first. After a short period of time I just snapped out of it and drove as fast as I thought I could without wrecking the car. I felt the only chance we had at it leaving us alone was making it to the nearby highway. She continued watching the craft from the window of the car while I drove. She noted it changing direction and following us. It was practically on top of us when we made it to the highway.We both lost sight of it for a short period as we continued driving down the highway.  Then we started seeing it sporadically through the trees to our left.  It seemed to be continuing in the same direction we were driving.  We decided to pull over and observe the UFO. This time it we did not feel threatened as it was much farther away from us. When we caught sight of it again it was extremely high in the sky. Now we were able to see a blinking red light on another side of the craft. At first I thought perhaps it was a plane and we had really lost sight of the UFO. At this point it started descending. It was coming down in kind of steps. It would drop straight down and hover then drop again. This is when my girlfriend noticed the problem. That wasn&apos;t our UFO at all. It was a second one. We saw the craft that had been following us moving extremely low to the tree line, almost in the trees. We could see both the bright white lights and the flashing red one on the UFO now. It was obvious the two UFO&rsquo;s were the same type of craft. They were moving towards each other. The lower one was practically underneath the higher one. Then it seemed as though the lower one turned. All we could see of it was the flashing red light. I started wondering what made it turn and if it was coming in our direction. I was keeping an eye on them and the fact there wasn&apos;t nearly as much traffic on this highway as I&apos;d like. Infact, at that moment there was no one to be seen. Then she uttered the worst words I&apos;ve ever heard, &quot;Did you see that, over in the trees?&quot;  I glanced over to see what she was talking about. To the left, directly across the 4-lane, in the trees we saw two tiny light blue blinking &quot;lights&quot; next to each other in a straight line. The way they were positioned so close to each other made me think of eyes, though I do not know if that is what they were. They were too high to be the eyes of any animal I know of in the area. There were no buildings and no people in the area either. They also were not responding like an animals eyes. They were actually blinking, like twinkle lights on a fade switch. There was no light pointed in that direction for anything to be reflecting. There was nothing but darkness and our car lights pointing directly in front of us. My girlfriend told me she&apos;d seen it blink at least five times before saying mentioning it. The mere thought of what it might be scared me enough to immediately pull out onto the highway and drive quickly away. We kept searching for the UFO&rsquo;s as we drove toward Huntsvill! e. We were unable to clearly identify the crafts again.",

I was on my way home from the store and my daughter,who is 5yrs. old, said she made a wish on the wishing star. When I looked at the star she was pointing at I noticed that it was not the planet Venus, which was the largest star besides the moon in the sky and in the wrong place, it wasn&apos;t a star at all.  It was just a very large, very bright light hanging low in the sky.  I was driving home about 10 minutes though open fields and in a large valley which you can see the mountains in the distance.  I kept it in view as much as I could, it was very low to the ground and varied in its brightness, but I couldn&apos;t get a good look at the shape.  As I approached our road, I realized that it was hovering somewhere around my house, so I turned in my lane and when I got back to the house it was over the woods directly behind my house. I got my camera and took a few still pics with the! night vision.  I would have taken video but my disc was full.  So I watched it for several more minutes and talked to my husband on the phone outside while watching it and then after we hung up I decided to get back in the car and try to get a better look at it on the next road over, because it was dancing behind the trees.  I took my daughter and we rode to the next road over, but it was gone.  I live in a fly through area and we get lots of planes and aircraft, but nothing like this. It was silent and very bright, much brighter and closer to the ground than a star could ever be. Im not sure what it was. I hope someone else saw it too. Thanks.",
20100519,20100519," Shamokin (Coal Township), PA", cigar,5 seconds,"Saw a white flatish oval or cigar shaped white object for 5 seconds and then it disappeared. Clear blue sky with no clouds.This sighting happened to me as nearly as I can recall back about two years ago, during the month of July of 2008. It may have been something like July 15th or so.I was out in my backyard cutting the grass and I sat down to rest a bit on a 3 foot high railroad tie fence at the back of my yard. My back yard has an elevation slope of about 4 degrees which is why I usually need to rest since half of the grass cutting is &quot;going up hill&quot;.As I looked up to the north, I noticed a white object floating or stationary over the crest of the mountain ridge which, from my back yard is about 1 1/2 miles north of here. I know it&apos;s about 1 1/2 miles from here because of the time it takes for the sound to reach me from the annual fireworks displays each year. Although the fireworks originate from an area on the crest of that mountain about a mile west of here, so for the timing of the flash of fireworks to the &quot;boom&quot; is about 9 seconds, but since where I saw the &quot;UFO&quot; is a shorter distance, so I approximate it to be about 1 1/2 miles (7 to 8 seconds).I put the shape of the object in your form as &quot;cigar shaped&quot; although that&apos;s not exactly it&apos;s correct shape. I&apos;m a former technical illustrator and since I smoke cigars I&apos;m well aware of the fact that cigar shape doesn&apos;t exactly describe it perfectly. The upper and lower sides weren&apos;t exactly parallel as in most cigars, but slightly convex - very slightly. And each end of the craft was round, not like in most cigars which are round on one end and the lighting end is flat or just cut straight off.But anyway, that&apos;s the best I can describe it verbally, but with drawing it I could draw it exactly as it was.The craft was just white, not shiny metallic like an aluminum aircraft.  Also the craft wasn&apos;t blindingly emitting a strong source of light, it was just white like a white object.  One thing that I noticed was that there didn&apos;t seem to be any shadow on the underside of the craft,  It was just all white.I took about 1 second to adjust my eyeglasses and then when looking back at it, it just wasn&apos;t there anymore.Now I&apos;m 74 years old and have been wearing eyeglasses for about 65 years so I&apos;m well aware of whether or not it was a white piece of fluff or object on my eyeglasses.  The craft I saw I clearly focused on. It wasn&apos;t an object on my eyeglasses.  I know the difference after 65 years.  I was a member of the USAF for 4 years and also have my Private Pilot&apos;s Certificate so am used to viewing object in the sky.So when I looked back to the object after first seeing it  for about 5 seconds it was just wasn&apos;t there anymore.My theory as to why it wasn&apos;t there anymore is that either:   1 - It zoomed away in that time, or else,  2 - It just became invisible in that time.Incidentally, I know clouds can disappear in only a few seconds, like about  5 seconds at times, but this object disappeared in only one second.  I know that in film clips on TV that clouds seem to disappear in only maybe about 1 second, but that&apos;s only in time lapse filming.  This object disappeared in real time in only 1 second.So, there you have it. Every time I go out to cut the grass now, I always keep an eye on the sky here but haven&apos;t  seen that object anymore.  I keep looking but so far, no luck.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.  PD))",

I say this because they came into view as I was looking toward the back fence which runs parallel with a street that runs in an East/west direction. One light was in front of the other but not in a straight line like single file, they were slightly offset from one another. They stayed the same distance apart. The speed remained steady. They did not zigzag or bounce around, or waver.I heard no sound from the lights as they passed overhead.I couldn&apos;t decipher any definate shape to the objects. The edges . They were diffused or hazy; the same way street lights or headlights appear to me, with a kind of halo effect.They seemed to be going slow but in reality they had to be going fast as they disappeared out of sight within seconds. Because we live on the outskirts of the flight path of an international airport and airplanes pass over all the time I&apos;d say they were considerably faster than any airplanes I&apos;ve seen.It&apos;s kind of hard to judge the size of the objects as there was nothing relative to compare the size with, but I&apos;d say they were at least as large as a commercial airplane, maybe larger.",

On the night of May 12, 2010 I was taking a series of Images (over 80 images in total) of stars for a composite star trails picture.The image I captured that is of concern, shows a green streak traveling from northwest to southeast. Each exposure was for 5 minutes at a 400 ISO at f3.5 and was taken at 11:25.I&rsquo;m used to seeing meteors and satellites in my images, but never like this. A friend of mine who is a professional astronomer and the Curator of an observatory in Washington state examined the image and can&rsquo;t explain it either.When the image is zoomed in on, there are no others lights are visible (like red or white for an aircraft). The astronomer and I both thought that perhaps it was just a meteor that was heavy in nickel, that would show as green as it heated up. But on second thought, he felt that in his experience (which spans decades) he&rsquo;s never seen a green meteor that would take up a whole trail like this and be this brilliant.The laser idea also came up, but I&rsquo;ve been doing this for a long time, and had green lasers in my field of view for star trails images; in my experience they&rsquo;ve never shown this brilliant, if at all.Also, if it were a laser, they would have had to hold it steady for 5 whole minutes, an almost impossible task. The streak also shows that it was very quick, because it doesn&rsquo;t move in motion with the stars in the background.I&rsquo;m open to any ideas&hellip;thanks!

There were no visual obstructions and no wind.  After watching it for approx 5-6 min there were 2 smaller flashes of light that came from the bottom of it and then would disappear.  The object would hover for a little longer then it would vanish.   This ritual happend 3 times in the course of approx 40 min. Besides myself there were 2 other witnesses. There were various aircraft to be within the vicinity as well.,
20100520,20100520," Sarasota, FL", changing,6 minutes,"Red and Blue lights jerking across the sky and multiple helicopters circling the event during and after.I received a call from a friend to look at some weird lights in the sky.  He described them as red and blue lights moving back and forth like a kite (they saw it from 10-10:13pm prior to calling me @ 10:13). At approximately 10:13pm on May 19, 2010 I looked out the back window of my house and saw four red lights lined up horizontally, they were stationary at this point.  They had an LED look to them, very bright and focused points of light, not beams.  I immediately told the two friends I had at my house with me to come outside and see it.  When we came out it was gone, but there were many helicopters in the air circling (at least three).  Then the four red lights came back into view as they quickly moved straight upwards from behind the buildings directly to my West until they were approximately 20 degrees above the horizon, at this moment the object transformed instantly from four red lights into one slightly larger blue light and headed in the exact oppos! ite direction straight down.  The change in color, direction and number of objects seen happened simultaneously and it appeared to move sharply with no acceleration or deceleration and did not seems to make any noise.  The four red lights from end to end were approximately two to three times as wide as the moon was from my vantage point and the blue light was about a third as wide as the moon.  I was located at Nutmeg Avenue and Lexington Street in Sarasota, FL facing between W and WNW.  My friends who called me were standing at Superior Avenue and Gulf Gate Drive in Sarasota facing directly North, it was about 15 degrees above the horizon from their point of view.  The helicopters that were in the sky circled this area for about twenty to thirty minutes after we last saw the lights.  Afterwards, I called every news station in town and they all confirmed that they either did not own a helicopter or it was grounded at the time.  I also contacted the County Sheriff&rsquo;s Departme! nt and they confirmed that they did not have their helicopter ! in the a ir.  I called everyone again the next day (5/20/10) and asked if they would confirm that they had no helicopters in the air at that time.  They all confirmed.  Next I called Air Traffic Control at the Sarasota International Airport, they said that they knew of nothing, but gave me the FAA Flight Standards contact information.  After asking about the helicopters, I explained my story to them.  About an hour later I received a call back from the FAA, the gentleman I spoke with was very friendly and helpful but could not give me any answers.  He suggested I contact NUFORC at that point.  That leaves me with two lingering questions: 1) What did we see? 2) Whose helicopters were in the air, why were they there and what do they know about the events we witnessed?",

There, hovering above the UT Tower was a triangular shaped craft aprox. 100 yards in length with amber colored glowing half-bulbs at each corner underside of the craft. It made no noise and hovered for about 20-30 seconds.Everyone on the street saw it and we all pointed at it. I was very excited and the feeling I had was one of pure elation.The object moved silently towards the south and downtown area of Austin and then seemed to accelerate and was out of sight within a fraction of a second.The next day on the local rock radio station KLBJ, they announced that if anyone had seen anything unusual the night before it was because the Air Force was testing something.I later became a weather technician for the Texas Air Guard and even though I was already familiar with most military craft I became an expert at recognizing all atmospheric phenomena and different types of aircraft as was required by my job.I do not believe nor have I ever believed that this huge, silent golden triangle was of a terran origin. I have only found one other witness online to this event who saw it 30 miles to the north of Austin and he stated that he saw several small shapes flying around the triangle as it headed south towards the Austin area.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

20100522,20100522," Lee&apos;s Summit, MO", triangle,10 minutes,"Black triangle in Lee&apos;s Summit, MO near Lake JacomoMy 17 year old daughter and I were on our way to my oldest son&rsquo;s home at approximately 9:24 p.m. on May 22, 2010. We were driving west on Colburn Road heading toward Highway 291 in Lee&rsquo;s Summit, MO. The sky was clear to partly cloudy and there was little or no wind. There is a small airport near Colburn Road on Douglas Road in Lee&rsquo;s Summit and I often watch the planes come and go while driving that strip of road. Tonight I was watching what I thought was a plane. The object had one red light and two white lights, pretty typical of the small planes which fly out of the tiny airport, except none of the lights on this plane were flashing like they usually do. I did not think anything of this because many times when a plane is coming at me head on, I cannot see the flashing tail light. As I got closer to the object I realized it was not a plane. The object was in the west heading east. I was driving west on Colburn Road. We had just passed Lake Jacomo and were i! n the outskirts of Lee&rsquo;s Summit. As I got closer and finally under the object I looked up and realized the object was a black triangle and not a plane. It was completely black except for the three lights. I am an educated person who has a B.A. in Psychology and I am currently pursuing a Master&rsquo;s in Counseling. I am aware of the Gestalt Theories and this was not my brain &ldquo;filling in&rdquo; lines. The sky blackened and there was no background filter light between the three lights on the object as it flew past me. The object was flying low and the night sky was not yet completely dark so I was able to get a very good look at it. I said something to my daughter who then looked at it and got very excited exclaiming, &ldquo;I see it mom it is a triangle! I see it! I see it!&rdquo; My next thought was it was a B2 bomber because Whiteman Air Force Base is only about 45 minutes away. However, as low as the object was flying it definitely was not a B2 because it was way too small. I have seen those fl! y around our area quite often and they are huge, especially wh! en flyin g low. I asked my daughter if she could track it, and she said she could. I made a u-turn to try and follow the object so I could get ahead of it and stop the car to get a really good look at it while standing still and hopefully take a picture on my cell phone. Unfortunately I lost the object in the street lights when I started heading east. While I was driving west the lights had been on the north side as I looked west. I was basically looking away from the lights and they were on my right side, which was the passenger side of the car. Now that I was driving east, the lights were shining in my eyes on the driver&rsquo;s side of the car and I could not see the object anymore. However, my daughter still had the object in her sight and I followed it as she guided me. Then as I approached the intersection of 7 Highway and Colburn Road, my daughter stated the object had suddenly shot straight up into the sky and disappeared into some clouds. We lost the object and I was unable to get! a really good look at it while standing still. I don&rsquo;t know if anyone else witnessed this object in Lee&rsquo;s Summit tonight and I don&rsquo;t know exactly what it was. I can only say what it was not. It was not a B2 Bomber because it was too small; and it was not one of the small planes that fly out of the municipal airport in Lee&rsquo;s Summit because I have never seen any of those planes make that triangle shape. I drive that area daily and nightly to and from work and school and I have lived here for 10 years. I have seen planes come and go from that tiny municipal airport day and night and none of the planes have ever made the triangle shape I saw tonight. Though I am a believer in UFO&rsquo;s, whenever I observe anything in the sky I do so with a very skeptical mindset. I always think of all possibilities before saying what I saw was &ldquo;unexplained.&rdquo; Tonight I honestly cannot think of anything that is as small as the object I saw and makes the shape of the black triangle which I saw in the! sky earlier this evening.",

Thinking it&apos;s probably a plane or chopper, I just kept watching the sky. But then I noticed that the twinkling/flashing light was moving pretty fast, and was hovering above a smaller light.  As it flew before me, it spinned like a baton at least three times before I noticed it was somewhat cigar/rod shaped.Meanwhile, I was also trying to get my mother&apos;s attention without keeping my eyes off the UFO.  I tried to speak, but all I could say was &quot;Oh my G-d!&quot; and &quot;Look!&quot;.  My mother didn&apos;t see anything except the larger twinkling light.

The objects, of what I can say were chevron shaped, and silver, traveled at a faster pace than an airliner, heading SW, and at an altitude,  I would guess, of 15 to 20 thousand feet.

They seemed to move independently, and moved in different directions and different speeds. They were also different sizes which I guess was to do with distance, some must have started to come closer as they were getting bigger, some getting smaller and dimmer. Over time they seemed to go out of visable range, getting smaller/dimmer before dispearing into the horizon, or shooting up into the sky. A few minutes later there seemed to be 3 more launch off from the ground into the sky, these were in formation.Eventually they all disappeared, but over the course of the next 20mins, more were seen, to be moving around the sky.

We were headed to his Uncle&apos;S  house for a casual New Years Eve family gathering in Wheaton.  As we headed west on Warrenville Road we spotted a light suspended in the sky over the field next to the road.  It was a clear quiet night.  I begged my ex to pull over to the side of the road so we could get a better look at it.  There was nothing attached to the light...no tower beneath it; nothing from which it was suspended.  Once we stopped (as did a couple cars in front of us and 1 behind us) the light started scanning the field beneath it (EDGE OF mORTON aRBORETUM). I rolled down my window to listen for some type of engine noise...thinking maybe it was attached to a small aircraft (thinking manmade)...I could only hear a PULSATING humming/vibrating noise similar the noise of power line towers.  As I reached for the door handle to get out of the car my ! ex grabbed my jacket sleeve and said, &quot;no! Don&apos;t get out!&quot; I pleaded with him to back up so maybe I could see it better...as he put the car in reverse and slowly startED back the object stopped scanning the ground and the light was immediately extinguished like a camera shutter closes.At that point my ex shifted into gear and sped away. My ex would never discuss what we saw admit to anyone what we witnessed and asked me not to, fearing people would think we were &quot;nuts&quot;. The event really upset him.HOWEVER, I have shared it with many people and I was very surprised to learn that there are tons of &quot;nuts&quot; on the loose.

It was round and was very white but looked filtered as if it was through clouds or fog around it, but there were no clouds at that time.

A few seconds later the light returned to its original size and as I was grabbing my video camera I looked up and it was gone.  This all took place over a period of about 10 seconds.

20100524,20100524," Charlestown, RI", other,1 hour,"Strange aircraft again over southern Rhode IslandWhile resting at East Beach in Charlestown, RI, at the above date and time, enjoying a beautiful clear blue sky and warm sun, I noticed a twin engine plane, with rows of windows on each side, and having pods at the wing tips (fuel?), white in color, flying a continuous loop over the beach, circling, slowly, then going away to the west, but coming right back.  I thought this continuous pattern of low flying, low level observation, was odd, especially after the fourth time of it flying right over me.  The beach was almost unpopulated, it being a Monday, and it being a very long 3 mile stretch of beach, and I was down about a quarter mile, away from most people at the entrance.  So, there were about fifty people on the beach but all but me and three other people were at the entrance.  I had my binoculars with me, so I decided to get a close up of the plane as it kept flying directly over me in its circling.  I first noticed no FAA identifying markings of any ki! nd on it...no numbers or letters, etc. I saw only one small blinking red light at the tip of the rear &apos;fin&apos; (aeleron?), and then I noticed a conspicuous large dark spot, like an oval camera lens, on the underside of the fuselage behind the wings.  I then thought this was some kind of secret government plane taking photos.  The plane continued its pattern of circling over the beach where I was, so I decided to leave and head for my trunk in the parking lot.  The plane made another pass, this time right over me in the parking lot, whereupon I took out my binoculars again to get another close look....while looking at the bottom of the &apos;plane&apos; I was shocked to see a quick flash of green light, very bright, come from what I thought previously was a camera lens!  This quick flash of green light was directed toward me, as if they were letting me know that they saw me, and maybe even were reading my thoughts.  It freaked me out, as I said, &apos;oh my God.&apos;  It was so unnatural a thing ! that it did.  This  was no ordinary plane by any means, but a ! craft ma squerading as a twin engine plane, but having a whole different propulsion and technology, as in the green light underneath.  There were no wing tip lights or any thing which I thought should be on a registered FAA plane.  It made a sound very similar to a prop plane, but different.  The windows were all blacked out, including the cockpit windows.  I then left in my truck and drove to Walmart about 5 miles away.  After shopping for a half hour I decided to go back to the beach parking lot to see if the &apos;plane&apos; was still there in its same circling pattern, and it was!  It flew a couple hundred feet above the shoreline, then circled over the salt pond in back of the beach, headed West again, and then repeated this pattern, over and over...nothing normal about it.  This is just one more strange aircraft sighting in this area.  My belief is that aliens are masquerading their craft as jets, passenger jets, and small prop/commuter planes like this one.  The strange &apos;camera&apos; spot/l! ens that flashed bright green at me while I was looking at it through the binoculars was the strangest event, and a bit intimidating...maybe that was &apos;their&apos; intent.  Something very strange in going on in southern Rhode Island...very strange.  By the way, the flashing green light did not emit a beam that I could see.",
20100524,20100524," Aransas Pass, TX", light,2.5 hours,"I saw floating lights dissapear and reappear many times over widespread areas going slowly west.12:46 PM 5/23/2010 Aransas Pass, Tx, 78336   At 9:00 pm on 5/20/2010,Thursday, I was at my home, sitting on my front porch. At the time I was working on a song that I had been writing, using a handheld synthesizer.  The sky had been mostly clear all day, but it was beginning to get a little cloudy. I needed to urinate badly, so I got up and walked to the side of our property and began my bussiness. It was then that I noticed that the moon was becoming extremely bright, so bright that I began worry that someone might see me, and become offended.  I then noticed that the light that was shining so brightly was not the moon at all, the moon being white in color.  This was yellow, so close to the color of a street light, that I thought for a brief moment that maybe someone had installed a telephone pole and street light in our yard.  That ridiculous notion was taken from me when the &quot;street light&quot; began to slowly move in the direction of the clouds.  The light had been so close to the ground that it had eclipsed the moon, but as it moved, I could see the moon again.  The light then seemed to shrink in on itself, not unlike a dimmer switch connected to a light bulb.  It startled me to the point that I had forgotten I was still indecently exposed.  As I stood there, mouth agape, I was starled yet again. This time it was bone chilling.  As a hole in the clouds opened up, I saw the night sky clearly. The stars were easy to see, and were clearly stationary, because the clouds were moving very fast, but the stars were remaining still.  But what startled me was the sheer number of yellow stars.  They were moving in the same direction as the clouds, and these &quot;yellow stars&quot; were above the clouds, because they would be covered up by the clouds as they moved.  It occured to me then, that the yellow lights were in our atmosphere, because they were much clearer to see than the stars.  I know they were just above the clouds, because some of them were doing what I had seen the first one I noticed doing. They  looked like they would have been part of the star field, but they were too many and too clearly observed. To be honest, I thought that we were being invaded. I know, I know, I watch alot of movies, but this was the real thing! I was honestly scared, and I figured that maybe I had better go tell my loved ones that I love them.  I was a little shaky as I ran inside to get my brother and mother. I got into the door, and stopped, realizing the enormity of what I was about to say to them. My mother looked at me expectantly, knowing somehow, that I had some important news. At this point I thought, if they are going to think I&apos;m going crazy, then I&apos;m going to force this on them, instead of just telling them. So I said,&quot; Mom, you have to help me now!&quot;  Then I turned, and ran out the front door. They followed me, but when they saw the lights, they came up short.  There were dozens, maybe hundreds, above the clouds, and they would show up in the dozens below the clouds.  However, when they would show up below the clouds, it seemed that they were there already, but not shining. Then the light would intensify,  sustain, then dim. Sometimes they would just dissapear into a cloud, and would actually &quot;burn&quot; holes in the clouds. I then called my grandma, my best friends, my other friends. Several of my friends were in different places, a couple miles away, but when they went outside, they were amazed. Many people saw these lights, and I think many people are afraid to admit it. I was just watching them, when three jets came roaring in a speeds much faster than lights were moving. The lights did not appear to flee. Instead, they just dimmed down, until you could not see them. They would appear in different intervals in many different places, only to dissapear again. After that there were helicopters flying in really low. They could not get near a light, but it was clear that the pilots were aware of the lights, and desired to close in on them. But it was the same thing as with the jets.By this time there were very few showing up close to the! ground, instead they all seemed to slowly move on to the west! . At abo ut eleven  o&apos;clock, I had decided to get the little camera we have. I was waiting for another to come  low enough to photograph, but I had to settle for one that was actually at a high altitude. As I took the picture, and the flash went off, the camera died from loss of power. It was probably only coincidence, but the wireless internet at my house was knocked out of service at that exact moment. Upon recharging the camera, I found no picture recorded. That is too bad. I was so excited about seeing these things, that I lost my priorities. Next time I see anything like that, I&apos;m going to have a camera waiting.",

20100525,20100525," Springboro, PA", circle,30 min,"i saw a ufo land and aliens come out  Hello, It&apos;s 5/24/10 my name is ((name deleted)). I&apos;m 26 year&apos;s old with two little girls....I don&apos;t really know who to tell my story to.I&apos;ve had these strange sorts of events happening to me throughout my life.  They were coupled with different feelings... confusion, fear, disbelief.None of it really made sense until I saw in detail what I&apos;m about to tell you.  I knew that everything I had questioned before was no longer questionable.  It was undisputed in my mind.  It has been going on my entire life and now there is finally an event that proves (to me) that this is real.I&apos;ll start by telling you that my cousin ((name deleted)) was with me when this happened...  He has been in the navy now for about 8 years.  He is a trustworthy person and his word means a lot to everyone that knows him.  Not only is it me telling the story, but he can verify that what I&apos;m telling you is true.My cousin and myself were sitting on the back porch of my house (which was also my bedroom).  It was my bedroom at the time because it was a room enclosed with glass walls.  Some of the sections of the glass had been removed and either had screens remaining or nothing left in them at all.  Since it was summer, this wasn&apos;t really a problem.  I actually loved being in a room that allowed me to look outside at nature and even the stars.We had a couch-bed in the room that was unfolded at the time.  It was unfolded for most of the summer so that my cousin could sleep over and &quot;hang out&quot; with me.  The backside of the couch-bed was placed against the glass, so the unfolded bed occupied the space in the room facing the house.We were laying in bed trying to sleep but we spent most of our time talking instead.  Then, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a red glowing orb that came into view from behind the house and was slowly moving across the sky.  *See Attached Photo*  I got ((name deleted)) attention and we both watched the orb move across the treeline that was north of the trailer park.  It seemed to not be as far away as a plane should be.  It look to be about the size of a basketball approximately 50 yards away.  I then realized that it was getting closer and that it clearly was not a plane.As it moved across the sky, we watched as this incredible UFO was slowly moving toward a treeline where we assumed it would disappear out of our lives forever.But instead of disappearing into the sky... I could still see it through the trees moving towards the ground. I could clearly see it flickering through the trees and I would estimate it to be approximately 10 feet off of the ground as it entered the field on the left.  It had clearly made a 90 degree turn. At this point in time I realized that it was probably in the field that was on the other side of the treeline.  (Treeline: small patch of woods separating the trailer park and a field.)  It traveled the length of the field before I could not see it through the trees anymore.  I would estimate the length of the field to be about 200 yards.My cousin and myself sat in awe even after we could not see the UFO anymore.  He turned to me and said &quot;let&apos;s go check it out!&quot;  I sternly answered with, &quot;hell no! are you f**king crazy??&quot;  I was not sure what I had just seen but I had a gut feeling that I did not want to find out. So, we waited...waited... two young boys waiting to see something else as amazing as what they had just witnessed.Then it happened...A flash, as if someone had taken a picture from a camera, appeared at my friend ((name deleted)) trailer.  It was on the other side of her trailer, preventing me from seeing the source of the flash.Approximately two minutes later, another flash... this time, from the side of her trailer. I still couldn&apos;t clearly see the source of the flash.At this point, my cousin and I were starting to think something strange was happening.A few moments later, another flash. This time, I could clearly see the source of the flash... nothing.  It appeared as if the flash was angled towards ((name deleted)) house, although there was no source of the flash.  There was absolutely nothing visible to the naked eye that created this OBVIOUS flash.  Bud and myself both KNEW that flashes that are that distinct do NOT come from NOTHING.We waited about five more minutes still staring out into the trailer court through my glass room.  We were now more worried about what was in the court than what we had seen earlier.  Without speaking to each other for what seemed like five or ten minutes, another flash happened.This time it was at my friend ((name deleted)) house - directly in front of my house.  The flash was on the other side of the trailer and appeared to be aimed at his mothers bedroom.  Again we waited... wondering what the flashes were.Another couple minutes had gone by.  Another flash.This time, it was clearly pointed at Tommy&apos;s window and there was NOTHING at the source of the flash.  In my mind I could pinpoint, to the INCH, where the flash had started, yet there was nothing there. ((name deleted)) looked to me and said,  &quot;what the hell are those flashes?&quot;  I had no reply.  I wanted to remain silent and hidden from whatever had been making the flashes.Again we waited.About another five minutes passed when there was a flash on the other side of Mr. Wilson&apos;s house.  (That wasn&apos;t his real name, but we knew him as Mr. Wilson in the trailer park.)  So, we waited what seemed like forever.  In reality, it was probably 15 to 20 minutes with no sign of flashes or anything similar to them.Quite suddenly, Bud looked at me and said &quot;well, I&apos;m getting tired. wake me if anything happens.&quot;  He then put his head right down on his hands where he was sitting (propped up on his knees on the backside of the couch bed).I said, &quot;okay&quot; but wondered how anybody in their right mind could just fall asleep that fast after witnessing what we had witnessed. In my mind,  I would not go to sleep until the sun was up and people were awake.I started to get the strange feeling that the happening wasn&apos;t over.  Then... I started piecing things together that were quite simple and obvious.1. ((name deleted)) lives with her mother and father.  There were 3 flashes at her trailer. (aimed at their bedrooms&hellip; )  2. ((name deleted)) lives with his mother. There were 2 flashes at his trailer. (aimed at their bedrooms, also...)  3. Mr. ((name deleted)) lives alone. There was one flash.I figured that if they had gone through flashing every individual, as they went around from left to right in the court, since Wilson was last they had to turn around and come up the other line of trailers...starting with mine.I almost panicked as I came to the realization of what I believed was true.I turned my head in the direction of where I believed the thing causing the flash to be.  As I turned my head I could clearly see out my window (one that did not have glass or screen in it - open - nothing obstructing my view) an alien.  I had turned quick enough to spot him before I saw a flash come from, what seemed like, his forehead..........When the flash hit me, he disappeared and I realized I was completely paralyzed.  As I tried to move my limbs, I looked around to realize that I was no longer on the same part of my bed that I had been during the flash.  I was, in fact, at the foot of my bed on my knees staring at the open window as if nothing had happened. Instantly, the numbness was gone.I grabbed the back of Bud&apos;s leg (because he was in the same position that he had been in when he laid his head down...)  It appeared that he had not moved at all.  But somehow I was at least 4 feet away from where I was when I had seen the flash...?  When I grabbed his leg I screamed extremely loud &quot;BUD! wake up!&quot;  His head came off of his hands with his eyes wide as if he knew something wasn&apos;t right.We didn&apos;t have to say anything to each other as we both jumped up and ran into the kitchen.  We each armed ourselves with butcher knives, not knowing how much time had gone by or if the threat was still around. He asked me what had happened.  The only way I could really describe it to him was &quot;I was flashed..&quot;  Bud KNEW what I meant by that, which told me that I wasn&apos;t just seeing things and that I wasn&apos;t alone.After about two minutes of silence.. waiting for something else to happen.. we finally laughed at the fact that we were standing armed in the kitchen with knives... waiting for aliens to come.It seemed ridiculous to us.  Although it had clearly just happened, we couldn&apos;t really wrap our minds around it.  So, we laughed it off and this time we went to bed INSIDE of the house, instead of the room surrounded with glass windows.(This event has made me realize that more than one time in my life - for a split second - I have seen aliens and &quot;the flash&quot;. I have seen them in my bedroom window... I have seen them outside of my tent while sleeping in the woods* the same woods that are between the trailer park and the field I described*... I have had many occasions where, just for a second, I believed that I had been part of an alien abduction. Seeing what I have seen and the fact that I have witnessed a UFO, I have seen that UFO land in my field, I have seen something flash friends and neighbors, and I have been flashed by something that came from the sky... this is not your ordinary alien story because to this day I cannot say that I fully remember ever communicating with an alien or being aboard their &quot;crafts&quot;. But that doesn&apos;t mean that I haven&apos;t seen, felt, or experienced something extremely out of the ordinary. My cousin was there as a witness to the UFO and to all six flashes... (the seventh, of co! urse, being my own) I have no explanation as to WHAT exactly the flashes are or WHAT they do to people, but I do think that they were meant for individual people... and to somehow make a person &quot;unaware&quot; that something is going on... whether by putting them to sleep... paralyzing them... or wiping out their memory... I don&apos;t know for certain. What I do know for certain is that I have had many encounters with them and I believe that I truly know how they arrive. To put it bluntly, I&apos;ve caught them in the act of flashing people. I believe that they were completely unaware that I had spotted them, until it was too late. I feel as though they knew that they had made a mistake. I had witnessed their mistake and I almost FELT the reaction of the alien as.. panic. For the instant that I saw him, I knew in my gut that he was as scared of me as I was of him. I knew that their &quot;routine&quot; was not supposed to have been witnessed by anyone. We are supposed to be dazed and unaware by the ! flash when they come.)((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",
20100525,20100525," Dallas, TX", disk,10 seconds,"Ok, first of all I want to say that I DO NOT wish to gain popularity, money, fame, etc. from this, all I want is to let everyone know that there are very mysterious things going on and I wish I could know exactly what.  I just feel like I need to tell somebody now because what I saw was incredible.  I have told a few friends but I am most definitely sure that they think I saw something(I don&rsquo;t care if nobody believes me, I know what I saw).   I love to watch the UFO television shows but I am the type that has to see something in order for me to believe so if my friends came up to me saying they saw something I would also may tell them I believe them but in the back of my mind I would probably think they saw something.  Well let me get started.  It was my friends&rsquo; birthday and we decided to go to the club 2009 in Dallas, Texas.  We planned on getting wasted and have a good time like we always do.  Well we got to the club and it was a normal night until I deci! ded to go out to the car and smoke a cig with my girl.  We got to the car around 1:45AM.  We were in the car facing north in the parking lot, I was in the passenger seat and she was in the driver seat.  We were having a conversation over something very old as we watched people walk by.  I remember looking at the security guard on top of the building patrolling, looking down, I guess to make sure nothing crazy happened,  it was around 2:15AM when out of the corner of my eye I saw  UFO floating from east to west as if to be a balloon.  As soon as I saw IT, I said &ldquo;Look&rdquo; to my girl and we both rushed out the car to look at the thing, we both are sure it wasn&rsquo;t a plane or a balloon especially because of its lights.  When we stepped out it seemed to have stopped and it just started getting smaller as it went up and before I could process what the hell was going on, it was gone!  The overall time it was there was around 10 seconds.  Well I must say I was a little drunk but it was! n&rsquo;t my first time drinking and in all my life of getting drunk! I have never seen things that weren&rsquo;t there especially disk like flying objects.  I also want to say that WE only saw if for a small amount of time so I don&rsquo;t want to give a description of it since it may be inaccurate but I do remember that it was circular and it had circular blue lights under it!  I also remember that it was kind of fat in the middle so it wasn&rsquo;t a perfect circle or sphere, maybe egg shaped but like I said I don&rsquo;t want to go into too much detail since I may be inaccurate.  All I know is that I saw something that I had never seen before and I really didn&rsquo;t believe in that stuff but I now know that there is &ldquo;something&rdquo; out there.  The object made no noise and when it started to elevate did not leave a trail/aurora, nothing, it didn&apos;t shoot off into space either like on television, it simply elevated very fast.  I am also almost certain that the guy patrolling on the roof saw it but I&rsquo;m not sure.  I also know it was around 2:15AM because my cousin called at 2:22AM a! nd by then I just kept talking about it and it had just happened. I also want to add that about 2 minutes after we saw the UFO we were standing outside(because I made my girlfriend stand by me just in case we saw something else) I was looking East of in the distance when I saw 2 star like lights moving up and down as if to be playing but when I told her to &quot;look&quot; they were gone!  That only lasted for about 3 seconds. If anybody has seen something similar I would love to hear about it and compare, I am really interested and excited because I now know we are not alone.  If you think I was too drunk or I am mistaken, NO! I know what I saw.  I wish I could have captured it on camera but I don&apos;t know why I didn&apos;t even think about it.  I will go there again and try to capture some proof.",

As we returned after our walk we sat in the back of his pickup truck and into the cloudy sky.  Towards the Eastern Horizon, just north of the city of Findlay, we spotted a bright light darting back and forth. The object would move at different speeds and changed directions north and south instantly. It also seemed to change altitudes as it proceeded towards where we were. As it approached closer to our position it fell to a lower altitude and maintained a steady speed and direction westward.  We then could see that it was in the shape of a triangle.  When the object was above it you could see a white spotlight shining through the low stratus clouds pointing strait ahead of it, and a row of four pulsating red lights on either side.  I can estimate that it was less than a football field above us and made no noise.  Judging by the ! trees around us, it was probably about 20 feet across, an equilateral triangle.  As it passed overhead the rear of the object consisted of four red lights that stayed a constant brightness in the pattern of a square.

We live in an area where there isn&rsquo;t much light pollution, so we were looking at stars.  We were trying to find constellations we knew, when two of us (myself and one of my friends) saw the light.  We told them to look as we watched it.The object first appeared to be star, which we then noticed was slowly moving.  It had been fairly faint, but still noticeable.  We hadn&rsquo;t been paying attention until it started moving.  It was in the north north-eastern sky and was slowly moving towards the south east.  As it moved it got somewhat faster, but also significantly brighter.  It got bright enough that it rivaled some of the other stars, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say it :lit up the sky,&quot; or anything that significantly.  As it continued to travel, it started getting dimmer and dimmer until it couldn&rsquo;t be seen.  I wouldn&rsquo;t say it traveled very fast, and it never got far enough to be parallel with us/over us (though its path wouldn&rsquo;t have allowed it go over us).  It was a clear enough night that had it been a plane we could have seen something as it continued further.  There was no flashing or sound; the light was white like any other star.There were three guys (counting myself) and two girls.  We were in high school. Nobody had been drinking, or doing any drugs of any sort.  Everybody saw it clearly and agreed that we couldn&rsquo;t figure out what it was.

I have already spent time trying to find other witnesses or reports, but came up short. Basically, this had to be one of the most incredible UFO sightings in recent time..I was 12 and it was during summer break.  I spent it at my grandma&apos;s house in Highland. I had a friend, Ryan, who lived across the street.  I spent the night at his house.  At around midnight (exact time, date and month unknown) me and Ryan were laying on his front lawn looking up, staring at the beautiful sky, talking about random topics.  Suddenly, and silently, a triangular shaped craft came into view.  A pretty damn big craft.  Our estimate was that it was several times the size of a 747.  It was relatively close to the ground.  It had to have been black because we saw no outline. We were able to see it was triangular in shape because it had many lights underneath.  I describe it as dim, smokey orange, green and yellow lights, with one big white one in the middle. We stood up shouting and screaming in fear and amazement.  Sometime during the event, I told him to go find a camera or video camera.  The craft suddenly shot a beam of white light to the earth (next to the highway on the! area of dead grass) and then retracted.  Then a few seconds later it shown a light seemingly through the top of it into the clouds.  I was watching it as it continued to fly off. My friend returned with his mom and no camera.  I think the craft was already gone because I remember his mom did not get a chance to see it.  We then noticed his neighbor working in his garage, but it seemed he didnt see the craft, and must not have been there during the event.  It was truely incredible.

The total time of the visible object was around 30 seconds. I could see the extreme humidity outside was very thick and can only see 1 or 2 visible stars.  After checking the ISS flyovers of St.Louis, there are no orbital paths flying over here until June so it wasn&apos;t an ISS flyover or a satellite, because satellites always give off a reddish hue due to the infrared light reflected back off the earth.  Again it was a bright white object started out as a dim light then in the middle of path grew extremely bright as the ISS is and then slowly dimmed out with a speed about as fast as the ISS flyovers are from what I can reference.

It was approximately 11:45pm.  I glanced up at the sky and I noticed what at first I thought to be a plane, flying in the southern sky, heading north.  The first thing that caught my eye was three, bright blue lights, almost the color of the lights on a black light.  I pointed this out to my friend, and he noticed how unusual the object looked also.  It was flying low enough that if it were an airplane, you would definitely be able to hear it; however this craft was completely silent. It was then that we realized this was no airplane.We immediately called my cousin and his two friends outside to look at the UFO. The five of us ran behind the house into the St. Collette church field. The three blue lights were flashing on and off, about every 3 seconds or so. When they were off, we could clearly make out the shape of the UFO.  It was a dark, circular shape. As the lights came back on, they were rotated, as if the UFO was slowly spinning.  We tried to get pictures of the object on our cell phones, but apparently it was too dark out and the UFO was too far away to get the shot, which was really frustrating.  We watched the UFO flying south for approximately 5 minutes.When the UFO was almost out of our view, about to go behind some clouds, all five of us noticed that it appeared to quickly move upward in a diagonal direction, and then move back down, as if it were making an upside-down &ldquo;v&rdquo;.  About 30 seconds after that, the UFO was out of our view.

In the Northwestern sky I stared at a light that was flashing looked to be a constant white and red.  I then pointed it out to my husband, at which point we noticed there was a triangle shape of two additional bright, flashing lights.I went inside to get some binnoculars to get a better look of the image.  When I returned the brighter light of the three I initially saw now was a constant white with a red flash on the left of the light, green flash to the right and the occasional yellow/ orange flash.  There was at times a set pattern and at other times no noticeable pattern.  About 15 minutes into the phenomenom there was a sudden brilliant blue almost indigo light that emitted and the object moved slightly up vertically.  The object then went back to the original light flashing of alternating the multi-color flashing.It was at this point I called my sisters that live roughly 3 miles away to see if the could see these lights.  I called neighbors to see if they too, were still awake and could see.  All that I was able to get a hold of, confirmed that they too saw what we were seeing.  My sisters stated that they could see 2 additional triangular shaped flashing lights of 3 in two different groups.  We looked to the southern sky and could immediately see two more triangle shapes with the same flashing.  Those were further out than the original that was still staying in the same place.We live just south of Louisville which is a huge UPS hub, roughly 11pm is a very major time for a lot of incoming airplanes.  All of these planes didn&apos;t appear to react in anyway to the flashing lights.  It also helped give us an estimate to the altitude, the planes were much higher.  The flashing lights were just above the tree line from our patio.Tried on multiple occasions to use a camera to photograph but all we had was an iPhone camera which isn&apos;t of good quality and couldn&apos;t pick up anything on the image.  We drove closer to where we thought the light was directly overhead to get a picture but could never get a decent quality shot.  When we came back home the original flashing light was much dimmer and had moved quite some distance away.  While watching it, faintly in the night sky I watched as it appeared to zip over to the other two points of its triange shape and then all three immediately disappeared.It was a fairly clear night, tons of stars out etc, but in the triangle masses there was nothing but pitch black.

It was a clear night sky so we decided to pull out a couple of chairs in the back lawn and chat while the dog did what dogs do outside.  Within five minutes of looking at the night sky I noticed what appeared to be a satellite or a plane at a very high altitude moving steadily across the sky.  The object appeared almost indistinguishable from a star except for the fact that it was moving.  I turned to my girlfriend to ask her which one she thought it was and when we both stared back at the moving light it was sitting in the night sky stationary.  I was immediately a little spooked because I was unaware of any plane, satellite, or other flying object that was capable of moving and then coming to a complete stop.  My girlfriend thought I was just seeing things but I convinced her to keep an eye on for a few minutes.  It is important to note that the light that was moving! was now sitting still at about an arms length distance, from my vantage point, of a small bright star.  We watched the object for what seemed to be five to seven minutes, and just when I convinced myself that I was just seeing things the object clearly moved another arms length distance north of its current position.  My girlfriend confirmed this movement and as we were talking about what it could be the object quickly moved east of its position.  The object started at a six o&rsquo;clock position, in relation to the small star near it, and when it became stationary again it was hovering at about a ten o&rsquo;clock position from the star.  We were so intrigued by what this could be that we watched the object for a total of two hours.  Within this two hour time period, the object made several more movements, displayed a red tint at times, and changed the level of brightness it was emitting several times.",

The majority of the lights were white but a few were red. The lights were very clear and visible on the objects. I stated to my son that he should look out of the back window of the car and see the lights but at then at that moment I noticed that there was more than one of the objects. Two of the objects were very close together maybe about 100 to 200 ft. and the other three were further away in distance. I keep telling my son to get out the car and look that I was not trying to be funny; he stated that he saw the object earlier and that he thought because it was in the sky that it had to be a blimp. I stated that a blimp is not that bright and that blimps does not hover like that! the light were very clear I could not put a shape to the object but it definitely was not that of a of a blimp. I don&apos;t believe that I have every encountered (UFO) the shape before. By the time my son got out the car to look only one of the objects was remaining. We watched the object until my son got across the street visible. I had attempted to take a picture but was unable to because the phone I picked up did not have a media card in it.  I went back to the window shortly after to see if I could see the object again but the objects had disappeared. There was a plane or are craft in the air at the time of the sighting. You could tell the difference because of the movement that the plane had I know a plane when I see one.  I am reporting this because the object was an UFO not to make jokes what you do with the information is up to you.

A large object.The sun was still fairly high at this time and was at my back.  In comparison the object would have been 1.5 times the width of the sun.  It could have been as long as a football field but what I saw at that distance looked like it took up the space a middle school spans.  Like a shopping plaza. It was white. WHITE.  It did appear to fade on the edge which was either some motion blur or reflection if it was shiny.  I can&rsquo;t say it was shiny but it did appear to be somewhat reflective on the edges.  It looked a lot like a flying cigarette.A white filter cigarette about the size of a shopping plaza passed over my area and looked like it was about two miles away.Our entire town here is only 1.7 miles wide. The area is heavily congested with shopping districts and we are within 4miles of the turnpike. The commerce traffic up here is huge both on the ground and in the air. There are always balloons, small private planes, military stuff, black choppers all the time from Willow Grove and who knows where else.There is a small airport within a mile of my home and others within two miles in neighboring towns.

My sight line at that point was looking upward more than likely 65degrees as the plane was traveling fast my gave follows it up and the cigarette either showed up or coasted into my site line and that damn thing just traveled real smooth from right to left even broke the plane of the smoke trail, no sound almost looked like it faded but I was squinting to see if this was an illusion but this thing traveled.  It did not dip, fade out, it was not smoke it did look like it could cloak itself. This is broad daylight&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.. A WHITE OBJECT on a light blue sky, CLEAR day!  It could have been a giant Frisbee.  Please help me.I watched the object for 30-60secs.  I don&rsquo;t have the exact time of day either.  I was so glued to it I didn&rsquo;t get to my watch, I hurried into the house to grab my binoculars that are by the door knowing when I came out I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to locate it.  It was white.  I never would have seen it if I wasn&rsquo;t looking at the jet.About 90mins later my neighbor north of my home two doors down meets me and my girlfriend out front on the sidewalk and I asked him if he saw anything within the last two hours and he verified a cigarette traveling westbound.  His sightline was toward the south which indicates to me the object had to have made a hard left after I went into the house.  His iteration to me has the object traveling towards the highway.

As usual, after getting out of the car, I stood there a while and look at the stars.  I was looking N/E and caught a flicker to the East.  I looked and saw, what I can only describe as, a fireball.  It was moving so slow that I actually watched it for about 30 seconds.  30 seconds!  It was moving easterly on a steady path and had a faint, but visible tail.  Whatever its distance was from my eyes, I can assuredly say that it looked the size of the full moon.  I could actually see movement in the color probably due to excessive heat. It was kind of like looking straight into a jet&rsquo;s afterburners.It was either a HUGE object or it was very, very close.  From my viewpoint, it looked like it was at a level where I would normally see jets coming in for a landing, but I&rsquo;m sure that was just an optical illusion.I saw nothing coming off the object like pieces or sparks.  It was round, clean and almost photoshopped-looking except for the faint pinkish spray of the tail.If this was a meteor, it was far too close for my comfort and there was nothing at all mentioned on the news.This is the second time I&rsquo;ve seen something like this. The first time, in the late 70&rsquo;s, was not nearly as spectacular, but just a thrilling.  As we were driving back from Newport Beach at 3:00am, that object went right over our heads, like a plane going down, then shot up at a very sever angle and out of sight, all in about 10 seconds.  No sound at all. Neither of us talked about it.  The people in the car driving next to us also saw it.  I looked over at them and they just shrugged.If I were to have taken a picture of either object it would have looked exactly like the gas bubble (without the fiery outer layer and red tail) on the &lsquo;In the News&rsquo; section of the C2C website, under &quot;Black Hole blows huge gas bubble.&quot;I&rsquo;ve never seen ball lightening in California. In any case, I doubt it would be as big as these objects.I am a Staff Assistant for an Engineering of a Municipal utility.  I worked in the aerospace industry for 10 years, loving my company and every minute of work.  I have been intrested in everything to do with space, planets, astronomy,and etchnology since I was 1st grade - all due to a large panaramic picture my teached had posted on the Science Wall that dipicted the birth and death of planet Earth.

(Unfortunately I wasn&apos;t about to take my eyes of the May object to grab the binoculars.I now keep them under the front seat.)

20100527,20100527," Smith&apos;s Ferry, ID", disk,10 minutes,"When a disk UFO passes within a few feet of the truck cab, the Air Force calls it a lost missile.Idaho UFO history includes Cougar Mountain, Smiths&rsquo; Ferry.  I have noticed that much of Idaho&rsquo;s UFO history from before 1970 is totally missing now unless you happen to own a copy of Frank Edwards&rsquo; book, &quot;Stranger than Science.&quot;   I cannot find my issue, if I even still have it, but I know one of the entries from personal experience.During the summer of 1957 my Dad and my Uncle Paul worked together in a post and pole business located one mile west of Donnelly.  In mid-August of that summer they had an order to fill one hundred miles south near Nampa.  The flatbed truck was loaded and they left early one august morning.  When they returned late that night both were filled with an incredible story.When returning from the Nampa-Boise area they took the only route available which was Idaho State Route 15.  Years later the road would be widened and made a bit straighter and renamed SR 55. Uncle Paul was driving and my Dad was the passenger. Traveling north the trip was uneventful until the moment they turned onto Rainbow Bridge just north of Smiths&rsquo; Ferry. By the time they reached this area it was twilight or past 9pm. Also, there was no other traffic on the highway at the time. This area is also known as the Cougar Mountain area. At least once a decade, when traveling through the same area, I would ask my Dad to tell the story and point to what he saw. Most recently was in 2003, not too long before he passed away. The story never changed.In mid-August, 1957 at about 9-9:30pm, northbound Hiway 15 (55) passes Cougar Mountain Lodge and the road continues following the Payette River.  Both the road and the river become narrower with some zigzagging prior to reaching Rainbow Bridge.  The road makes a sharp right onto the bridge.  At that point my Dad yelled &ldquo;STOP!&rdquo; and the old flatbed truck was nearly in the middle of the bridge before coming to a complete stop.  What my Dad had seen was something large and glowing coming right up the river at about the same level above the water as the bridge. As they came to a stop the large object rose slightly to avoid the bridge and missed the cab of the truck by mere feet. Once over the bridge it dipped about 30 feet down to the river then pulled up in a high arc reaching about 500 feet higher than they were, then dove straight down onto the top of a hill. They watched a bit of an explosion, but did not notice any burning of the dense forest. The land had not been logged and th! erefore no roads existed leading to the crash site at that time.My Dad described the object as circular and shiny on top with a nearly flat bottom. The entire disk glowed with a bright purplish color and was traveling up the river and through its arc at about 60 mph. It was half the width of the bridge making it about 100 feet in diameter.  My Dad would seem to be a good person for observation. He was retired from the Air Force with the rank of Master Gunnery Sgt. He had been in the Flying Tigers and when evacuated from China he was sent to school for the Norden Bomb site and spent the rest of the war in the Flying Fortress. He told stories of &ldquo;Foo Fighters&rdquo; and the first momentary glimpse of this disk coming up the river immediately triggered his old reaction to those earlier foo fighters. Unable to do anything about the crash, the two men continued north for a half hour reaching Cascade, the county seat for Valley County. There they stopped at the police station and filed a report.During the evening of the next day an Air Force Officer dropped by the house and explained to my Dad and Uncle that what they saw was no more than a missile that had been accidentally launched from a jet out of Mountain Home Air Force Base, southwest of Boise. The officer added that &ldquo;You have no reason to be concerned and should just forget about the incident.&rdquo; I remember looking at the smiling officer and then at my Dad just staring at him for a moment. My reaction was to try to melt in to the background and be out of site for a while. Very calmly my Dad explained to the young smiling officer that he was retired Air Force, added a few details, and knew a missile when he saw one.  He then invited the officer to change his story or leave. That was the last we heard from the Air Force about that incident.The crash at Smiths&rsquo; Ferry was at 44&ordm; 20&rsquo; 11.57 N and 116&ordm; 03&rsquo; 27.54 W and by the following day, the Air Force had the entire area stripped clean.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

20100527,20100527," Somersworth, NH", disk,5-10 seconds,"Saucer seen from about 40 feet away at top of trees in Somersworth, NH, 36 years ago.While attempting to write a book for the first time ever (which is not about UFO&rsquo;s but will include my UFO story),  I am once again recalling the past by searching for the time frame again, I come up with a related article that inspires this report.I&rsquo;ll just get right to the point here.It was the evening of August 16, 1974. I was about 16-17 yrs old.   After picking up a girl in my car, we went to the local parking area. At that time it had the nickname &quot;Pregnant Point&quot; (how appropriate).This area is located in Somersworth, NH between two roads that run parallel to one another:  Salmon Falls Rd and Rt 108 (the old Rt 16).  No more than a mile between the two.  This road today starts at the corner of a local tool crib and almost across the street is a gas station that once had the name Agway.   From Rt 108, going towards Salmon Falls Rd, there is a dirt road to the right and that&rsquo;s where we had parked that evening.   Backed into the woods on the left hand side perpendicular onto this road we sat talking (completely sober) and while talking we noticed what appeared to be a star way off in the sky that would just grow bright and then fade and continue to do this for awhile.   We at first thought that it could have been a plane but didn&rsquo;t move at all.   After a few minutes we had just ignored it.   While looking at one another and talking, I glanced back at the sky and went into a sort of horrific shock by the presence of a huge saucer hovering no more than 40 ft or so just above the tree tops across the dirt road we were on and no more than 25-30 ft away.  It was aprox. 75 yds or so in diameter, silverish from what I remember and had numerous lights revolving around the bottom rim.I was in such a state of shock, that I couldn&rsquo;t even speak with tears running down my face and trying to speak but only had an open mouth with no words.  This girl whom I have no idea to this day who she is, didn&rsquo;t see it at all at this time and kept asking me what was wrong.  She was kinda freaked by my state of shock.  This saucer made absolutely no noise and vanished in about 5-6 seconds maybe a little longer but not much.As soon as I was able, I started my car and still unable to talk, took a right back onto this dirt road and then another right back onto pregnant point (this girl kept asking me what the matter was).  I still couldn&rsquo;t talk at this time.As I turned left onto Salmon Falls Rd, she screamed like a blood curling scream from some horror film.  I knew then she had just seen it.  When I turned onto Salmon Falls Rd., she had spotted this UFO out the passenger window over the Salmon Falls River and the swamp next to it.Once in Rochester and no idea where I had dropped her off, I went home and called the Rochester Police to report what had happened.   All they said was, &quot;Thank you.&quot;  I was a little set back by the response but being young, I just let it go.   Who would ever believe me anyway?   I had told no one else until the next day because it was a little late that night.The next day, I was driving my car on Central Ave in nearby Dover, NH, and I tuned into the local radio station WTSN in Dover.  I hadn&rsquo;t talked to my brother ((name deleted)) at all.  ((name deleted)) had just come on WTSN because he was at that time, he was the Strafford County ((deleted)).He had reported UFO sightings in numerous areas; Exeter Police reported sightings from officers themselves, Dover Police had sightings over the Junior High School, Somersworth Police had sightings over the water tower and Rochester Police chased a UFO up Rochester Hill Rd which is actually Rt 108 (the old Rt 16) just a few miles from where I was.To top it all off, a friend (whom I had no knowledge of where he worked at this time) was in the local newspaper: &quot;Foster&rsquo;s Daily Democrat&quot; and had reported a confirmed sighting that night.  He was working at the Agway gas station no more than &frac34; of a mile in parallel to where I was parked.A few years ago, I had called the Rochester Police for police reports of that time and they told me that there were no records of my calling.  However, at the time of this writing I have physically gone in and put in a request for records.I later on had researched that time period and found ((name deleted)) report in the newspaper of Foster&rsquo;s dated August 17, 1974.  Some years later his brother and I were at coffee and he remembers his brothers sighting who now lives out of state.Since that time, I have told my story to WTSN in the late 1990&rsquo;s on a live call in show called, &quot;The Open Mike&quot;  program and have also told my story to  &quot;The Bay&quot; (98.7) radio station on an early morning show.What I saw is as real as you and I my friend.Today, the trees where I had spotted this UFO appear to have not grown as tall as the others nearby.  I hope that you can add this to your archives.Thank you for time for what this is worth.((NUFORC Note:  Time of sighting is not indicated by witness.

There was no engine noise, no sonic boom, just the light.Weather was partly cloudy, and there was a storm to our south, with lightening that we could see on the horizon. There were fireflies out-however, this was definitely not a firefly, because the color of the light was too white to be a lightening bug (our local fireflies are usually green), and the blinking was too fast. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what we saw, so I&rsquo;m hoping someone else saw it too!",

I observered the same type of object about one month ago.  I am a former Police Officer.During todays occurance I was sitting on the Southern back deck of where I live with a clear view of the Southern sky above about 45 degress from ground to sky.  I observed a white object moving at slow but consistant pace toward the west at an unknown altitude and it seemed to flow the basic flight path of flights leaving from McCarren Airport.  However its pace was a lot slower than the planes that I could clearly see leaving the area.  The object changed direction at a full ninety degree turn and proceeded north.  That&apos;s when I took notice of it really. I watched it come toward the north, stop and then go west and then came to complete stop for about five minutes.  I used a Telephone pole as a guide of movement.  It then darted south and stopped. Another white object streaked throught the sky a little way west from the stationary object.  That object stayed there until I came inside to find somewhere to report it.",

20100530,20100530," New Port Richey, FL", unknown,4 minutes,"Slow moving, starlike object brightens and dims as it goes.On Saturday night, May 29th at approximately 10:30pm I took the dog outside before going to bed. I always take time to scan the skies while outside after dark. Sometimes I take my night vision scope out because there are so many more stars and other objects that are seen with the night vision monocular than with the naked eye. Last night I took the scope outside with me again. I was able to see, what I believe were, two separate satellites traversing the night sky. These are usually always seen at least once a night through the scope.However, after looking at the sky for a good 10 minutes I was able to see an object that I could not identify. This object was traveling from west to east very high up. Because it was only visible through the night vision I could not discern if this object was within the earth&rsquo;s atmosphere or if it was out in space.This object moved much slower than the satellites I see every night, much slower. It also brightened and dimmed in a rhythmic pattern. While the object moved through the sky it would slowly brighten, stay bright for about a second and then slowly dim again to nearly invisible, staying dim for approximately 4-5 seconds. This pattern repeated itself during the length of time I watched the object. It didn&rsquo;t flash quickly or erratically, nor did it move briskly or erratically. This object stayed on the same course repeating it&rsquo;s brightening and dimming as it went.When the object was at its dimmest, it blended in with the smaller, less visible stars in the sky. The size and shape of it was very much like the rest of the stars. I was not at all able to see this object without the use of the scope, even when it brightened to its maximum luminosity. Eventually, this object flew out of sight. Given the slow movement, size and the fact the object was not visible without the scope, I believe this object to have been in space. If it was, it had to have been extremely large!  There were other aircraft in the sky during this sighting. I could hear and see an airliner coming from TIA in Tampa heading north and see smaller aircraft to the west heading south. These planes were much lower and faster than the craft I was watching.I am a paranormal investigator and have some experience in investigating and reporting unexplained events. I have seen satellites, the ISS, shooting stars and all kinds of aircraft as I have served in the USAF and currently reside in an airplane community; this object did not fit the description of any of these things. If anyone knows what this thing could have been or also saw it, I&rsquo;d love to know! This sighting really surprised and excited me.",

It was so dramatic that a car stopped and 4 people jumped out to look at it.Now I realize that this could have been a firework but it would have to have been an industrial/military type thing because these lights were really high in the sky.

They were in a perfect formation of approximately a 25-30% angle triangle with the center point above the other 2 outer low points. The points of light were way to far apart to be any plane or aircraft I have EVER seen!  I didn&apos;t see any distinct blinking lights like those from an airplane or any other common aircraft.  The individual lights would somewhat pulsate in intensity but not a true blink. One light would get brighter though the light didn&apos;t radiate outward to appear any larger, just brighter, as another would dim in unison. They seemed to &quot;take turns&quot; dimming/brightening.  I don&apos;t recall seeing any odd colors just white/yellowy lights.As I turned onto the freeway ramp I lost sight of it for a moment then regained sight of it to my right as I was heading north.  At this point it seemed as if the formation had slightly shifted but gone up a bit higher in altitude, though still too low to the ground for this to be a military type plane formation maneuver.  Now the northernmost light was slightly lower than the southern pointing light and it appeared closer to the center light, like how the perspective would warp if you had a solid triangular object and pivoted it slightly clockwise.At this point a fourth light appeared just barely above the tree line and even further back in the south direction than the back corner of the triangle and much lower.  This light seemed brighter and larger than the other three and seemed almost to be a tail???   Upon a quick glance at this point it would almost appear as if the little dipper had lost part of it&apos;s tail, it&apos;s bottom star, gotten very close to the earth and hovered there above Oregon City.Unfortunately I was not in a position to stop and shoot footage as I was running late for work.  I called home quick to see if my husband could see it but he could not even though we are on a slight hill.  The object was just hovering too low for it to be seen from many locations.  I say object, yet strange thing is I didn&apos;t see any solid object holding these lights in this formation.  It was BY FAR the oddest thing I have EVER seen! I have looked all over the internet, called news channels and even the local dispatch and NO ONE else seems to have reported this.  This is why I&apos;m posting this here. I am not crazy or anything but some verification that ANYONE else saw this would ease my mind! Thank you for reading.",

The light was a bluish spotlight that appeared funnel shaped and it was shining down just above the tree tops as it came toward us.  The leaves were all off the trees and we were just about to get into our car.  It dawned on me that there was no noise at all like a month earlier when Coast Guard heliocopters were searching for a lost kayaker on the lake beside us.  Suddenly, the large light went straight up to a pinpoint in a matter of seconds and zig zagged across the sky.  I called the local air control tower and he said no flights were in the area and he gave me the closest AFB in Oscoda and I spoke with their air controller who also said no military planes were in that area at the time.  He gave me an 800 number to call and report a UFO which I did, however, no one ever contacted me about it. A few months later on the front page of the Record Eagle newspaper was an article about another sighting in Kingsley,MI. about 12 miles from our home.  This time a State Police trooper saw one as big as a huge football field over a lady&apos;s barn.  He took some pictures of it (which were never released to the paper) and he and the lady watched it for about an hour.  It was never explained what it was that he saw.  I work as a nurse administrator and I did not report the event I saw with my kids because of the way people react.  I am 57 years old and my son was about 9 years old..  He is now 32 and he still recalls what happened too.  We feel we saw a real UFO.  My ex-mom in law the next day described what I had seen too and she lived about an 1/8th of a mile away.  She said she had never seen anything like it either.((NUFORC Note:  The source of the report indicates that the date is approximate.

At approximately 10:30pm I was leaving my office in downtown Oregon City.  I was walking to the place I normally park under the bridge when I remembered it was Saturday and I had parked right in front of the office where the meters don&rsquo;t run on weekends.  As I was heading back, facing east, I noticed four (4) lights over the cliff where the big Oregon City elevator is - Which coincidentally is shaped like a UFO. They looked fairly high up, about as high as a plane would be coming in for landing at PDX from that distance - Ten thousand feet, (10,000) maybe? They ascended slowly upwards, appearing over the cliff. Although they were shaped like a triangle, it was apparent they were separate objects in a triangle formation. As they rose the formation began to break up and they criss-crossed each other.  They gradually faded the higher they climbed, eventually disappearing altogether. As one formation began to fade another rose up over the cliff a! nd as similar pattern was repeated. They moved slow and consistent, like balloons being released on a calm day. There was no mistaking them for balloons, however, it was very dark and they were lit up by their own light sources, not the sun or moon.  There appeared to be 12 total but I could be wrong.  I was frantically trying to call my workmate who was still up in the office to get him to come down and see. He made it down in time to see about 4 of the remaining lights before they faded. The lights were red-orange in color and they did not blink, flare up or change shape.  They were simply very bright as the rose over the cliff and faded the higher they climbed. We waited about 10 minutes to see if anymore appeared, but that was it.  End of show.  On a personal note, I am 34 and have never seen a UFO before, of any kind, except on film.   The behavior of these lights reminded me very much of some films I have seen of UFO clusters in the day time. Silver orbs floating arou! nd like balloons, eventually ascending and fading out.

There was no moon in the sky  and the area is a farming valley so except for my headlights there was no other sources of light in the area.  I happened to look to the Eastern horizon and slightly north when I noticed four red lights in the sky in a diamond shaped pattern hanging what  appeared to be approximately 200-300 feet above the Northern mountain range.   Although these lights were in the distance I wasn&rsquo;t sure at the time what they truly were.  These lights were stationary and were constant at all times.As I continued to drive East I was beginning to notice that I was becoming aware that I was getting closer to these lights in the sky.  Growing up around an airport most of my life I knew an airplane or helicopter when I seen one, such as a strobe light on such craft.  These lights always kept the same distance telling me that they were on a craft and were apparently on one side of this craft, but because of the extreme darkness in the area I couldn&rsquo;t tell you what this craft look like.  For the next 20 minutes I continues to see this light pattern in the sky.As I approached an area of this freeway, where the freeway would now turn to go around portions of the Northern mountain side that came towards the valley floor I could not see the lights due to my view being block. As I came around the curve in the road, out of thin area four large orbs of light appeared over a little mountain right in front my view.  These lights were large, as large as a house, and were of white light with speckles of grey within the orb.  Each orb had a halo surrounding it in what was the same color as lighting yellow and lit up the top of this mountain, which had a power line tower on top of it,.  These orbs were also in a diamond shape configuration.  Although I had my radio on in the car I could hear an electrical discharge as they appeared.  Within a second or two from appearing they quickly disappeared back into thin air. I&rsquo;ll tell you that I was keeping my eyes on the road and trying to make sense of way I had just appeared and disappeared in front of m! e. As I cleared this part of the road and was traveling due East again and looked to the Eastern horizon and slightly North again.  Now I was approaching two sets of four red lights in the sky in a diamond shaped pattern side by side.  I opened my window and notice no sound from the air as I drove past these lights in the sky.I couldn&rsquo;t talk to anyone about this incident for two days because I was trying to process what I had witnessed that night.  I finally came to the conclusion that I had witness teleportation of an alien spacecraft.  I had witness alien technology in action.  After a while I began to tell people who I have known for at least several years about this event, including an older woman who was a widow.  As I told her this story, she told me her husband was a fighter pilot in WWII in the pacific theater.  He had spoke to her several times that while flying in daylight he saw a black disc object in the air with him which had four red lights on the back end of this craft in a diamond shaped pattern.

[OBSERVER 1/INCIDENT REPORTER BACKGROUND INFO.] Being both an avid astronomy enthusiast and the daughter of a retired USAF fighter pilot, I believe that I am a very good judge of determining the &ldquo;identity&rdquo; or cause of an illuminated and/or moving object in the sky.  Not only do I have a strong knowledge of what things in the night sky such as meteors/&rdquo;shooting stars,&rdquo; satellite/ iridium flares, planes, helicopters, etc., look like, but I also have a healthy dose of analytical skepticism from my father which I always apply when something out of the ordinary presents itself.When the topic of a UFO is brought up, I always think of the story of the &ldquo;Tucson Lights&rdquo; ((NUFORC Note:  ((sic))  Phoenix Lights))  that is shown on UFO shows on TV often and hoe my father finds it slightly comical how much that incident is still hyped despite the lights so clearly (at least to him) being from A-10 flares (he was an A-10 pilot for 20 years, with over 4,000 hours in the cockpit).  However, my father has always been deeply fascinated by UFO stories/sightings, and he is a firm believer that much more happened at Roswell in 1947 than what the government ever told the public.  My father has instilled in me a profound love and curiosity for all things flight and/or outer space related, as well as a strong sense of the importance of thoroughly reviewing/examining something before drawing any conclusions.ADDITIONAL NOTES ON SIGHTING]   The object did not enter from one end of our line of sight and exit at the other, but rather, it suddenly appeared in the middle region of the night sky visible in front of us, and seconds later, disappeared directly in plain sight.  It did not have the movement, luminosity, or any of the distinguishing characteristics of a meteor.  Although it appeared to be an illuminated aircraft of sorts (not just a streak of light), it moved far too fast to be a plane as well as in a somewhat hard to explain irregular path unlike that of any airplane.  Additionally, its light was not constant like that of a plane in the night sky. It simply appeared in the middle of plain sight, moved across the sky in a way and at a speed that I have never before witnessed demonstrated by anything else, and then abruptly vanished while still in a clear area in the middle region of the night sky visible to us.Having observed a comet, several meteor showers, a satellite flare, and of course, more planes and helicopters than I could ever hope to count, move through the night sky, what I saw in the sky this past night was almost bewildering, due to it being absolutely unidentifiable in any right.",

I was on my way to bed around 11:30pm when I went for one last cigarette, and when I looked up into the sky I saw a strange flashing object way up in the sky above my trailer park. This would be in the North East. The object stayed there for a while and bounced around in the sky from NNE to the North. I had just purchased a camcorder about a month before hand primarily for use in recording precious moments of my baby girl, so I went in grabbed the camcorder came out and started filming the thing, this time it was down lower in the sky. I then went in grabbed a flashlight, and the object flashed brighter at me when I flashed the flashlight at it, before it slowly made its way due North through the tree line. I immediately filed a police report and the officers looked at me as if I were a kook even though I had showed them the video. Later that morning my husband told me it may have been an in ! flight jet refueling procedure, but over our town? So I phoned the Cold Lake Alberta Air force base and reported my sighting there. Needless to say although I&rsquo;m a new mother with a sound mind and had many respected positions in my careers, I have been receiving flak about my experience. Upon researching websites, over the weeks following this incident, I was shocked to see how many reports of UFO&rsquo;s there actually are, and that this object has been seen in this part of northern Alberta for over the past ten years.Here is the first video of the object: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5R8i8XHt2g  I find I couldn&rsquo;t sleep and I went out ever night watching and waiting for this object to return. On May 24th around 3 am, I saw the thing again over the Catholic school, so I jumped in my car told my husband to watch the baby and went to the field near the school to try to get a better image of it. I made sure I purchased a tripod for the camcorder and this time brought along a 3 million candle powered flashlight.I discovered upon flashing the spotlight at the object the thing seemed to get scared? It went dark took off and stopped over the sawmill that my husband later estimated is about five kilometers from the school straight to the east. After about five minutes, the thing disappeared. I turned to go back to my car in the parking lot, when suddenly the thing reappeared over the trailer park again. It made a white semi circle glare, went dark and then sped off towards the radio towers north of town. I jumped in my car and followed the thing that stayed stationary over the field north of the towers. I couldn&rsquo;t get it on video because the thing had turned its lights off? But now I wonder if I was just following a satellite that disappeared, and I was just seeing things above the field? Needless to say I got really spooked standing out in the middle of a dark back road trying to get a (?) on video. I decided to get out of there, and head for home.So now I think I&rsquo;ve gone crazy, my husband doesn&rsquo;t believe me, and is questioning if I&rsquo;m fit to raise our daughter. I keep watching the video trying to stop the frames to get a clear view of whatever it could be which I&rsquo;m sure my husband was thrilled about. When on May 28th around 11:30 or a bit later before midnight, the weather had turned cloudy, so I decided to actually stop waiting for this thing to come back, and actually get to bed at a decent time. I was going for my last cigarette when low and behold there it was again this time up in the clouds to the NNW, shining away. The weather had turned overcast, and I checked the cloud ceiling on the weather network later to discover the ceiling was at 3900ft. So I&rsquo;m estimating that the object was another 500feet into the clouds. I keep my camera on a tripod now by the door, so grabbed it and started filming the object, and finally got a clear image of the thing. Its maneuverability is unbelievable, yet I still question coul! d this be a night kite an old man supposedly flies in a field a kilometer north from my doorstep? I got my husband out of bed, and he now believes me Thank-GOD! He says this definitely is not an old mans kite with LED lights on it. I looked everywhere online for any new technology a person could buy and place on a kite that would make it glow and pulsate like that, but so far haven&rsquo;t turned up anything remotely close to this thing.Here&rsquo;s the new clearer video I shot of it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SOu7NTHY-w  If anybody knows what this might be, please contact me through this report, Thank-you.",

20100531,20100531," Granite Bay, CA", changing,10 Minutes,"Strange color and shape changing light over Northern CaliforniaAt around 2:30 AM on May 30th, myself, as well as a number of friends and neighbors (roughly 30 in total), witnessed an object in the sky that we all believe to have been a UFO.  The object was first noticed toward the right hand portion of the sky, and at the time, didn&apos;t seem much higher than around a few hundred feet up (judging by the speed it was traveling, and the movements it made).  The object was round in shape, and moved across the sky towards the left, all while it&apos;s color changed from a vibrant blue, to green, purple, red, orange, and so on.  It wasn&apos;t making any sort of sound, and didn&apos;t seem to be moving like it had a distinct front/rear and left/right.The object then changed direction with seemingly no effort, and did something similar to a figure 8 (still only moving at a medium pace). Just after the erratic movement, the object then proceeded to change it&apos;s shape from being round, to a more cigar shape with what looked like a bend in the center (it almost looked like a DNA strand in shape).   At this point, the object&apos;s two &quot;halves&quot; both started to change their own colors, all while the object started to move south and in a straight line.  The shape slowly morphed back into being round (as well as it&apos;s color back to a white), as the object increased speed and continued straight.It appeared that my first guess of it was being a few hundred up was wrong, because after a minute or two of this, the object then started to flash 3 times consecutively, every few seconds, as if it were exiting the atmosphere.  The object eventually disappeared after another minute or so, and no further lights/objects were seen again.I myself am an avid lover of UFOs and their mystery, but had yet to see anything abnormal in my life until this happened.",

Come look!&quot;  I got excited, downed my lunch quickly, and went outside to the playground.  By the baseball field nearest the school, there were several other children standing and looking at the sky, and I looked at the sky and saw many, many small white spheres quite high in the sky.  They didn&apos;t seem to be moving, and I told the other kids they were weather balloons, but I wasn&apos;t really sure of what they were myself.They did not appear to be in any sort of formation, there were just a large number of white spheres widely spread out over the western sky.  If I had to guess, I&apos;d say that there were around 50 spheres, but I&apos;m not sure.  In the afternoon, the teacher gave us a short recess, and there were still white spheres in the sky, though there were fewer of them, I&apos;d say &lt;10, all seemed stationary.  After we were released from school, I could only see two of them.

There was hardly any traffic on the road because of the hour.  This neon blue light moved downward toward as if coming down a staircase.  The object stopped in front of a business park just to the left of us, approximately 25 yards away, and changed from a blue light orb to three neon blue squares linked together in a vertical rectangle tilted forward from the top.  The neon blue light pulsed at a very high rate and radiated from the the blue squares but the object itself made no sound.  The object itself appeared to be slightly smaller than the light on the light post next to it, approximately 10&quot; in length.  It hovered from side to side and up and down, turning sideways and back again; remaining in an a! rea of about 2-3 cubit feet.   As it turned sideways to reveal it&apos;s profile there didn&apos;t appear to be anything behind the blue light bar that we could see.   At first we thought it must be a toy.  There was not a single person around the object or in the parking lot of the business park.  Our driver said it could not be a toy because no transmitter could reach that far, given the fact that it descended from a visual point out of the night sky high above us.  A car coming from behind us also stopped to watch this intriging object as well as a man in a truck coming from the other direction.  The object then returned to the blue light orb and began traveling NE just above the roof tops.  It seemed to be traveling very slow at first so I told my friend driving to follow it.  Before we could get the car turned around the object acceleratled in a straight line NE and disappeared.I believe whatever it was came with an objective and that it traveled so low to the roof tops so that it could travel without much detection.  I also believe that it&apos;s destination were somewhere reasonably close or else it would have made it&apos;s descention elsewhere.  Northeast from where we were located is a military reserve base, Northeast Mesa and Fort McDowell Mtns.  I live right next to the military reserve base where there is a jet and pilot ready 24/7 for take off in case of an intrusion.

I was never completely sure about what it was that I actually saw, but I know what I saw was real.  I did not want to sound like a nut case, or someone that was trying to get attention through sensational happenings.  However, after years of watching programs about UFO sightings and reading testimonials of others that have described over and over almost exactly, in most cases what I witnessed, I have finally decided for sure that I saw a UFO that did not seem to be anything that could be designed and operated by people from Earth.My wife and I were driving home after checking on our employees that worked late shifts.  We were heading North on I-405 through Kirkland WA.  My wife was sleeping.  It was about 4:30 am when I saw a bright fluorescent sphere moving very slow from east to west.  It had just cleared over the top of a hill to my right and lowered to a few hundred ft. above the road.  Then it stopped directly above the road and hovered there for a few seconds.  I yelled at my wife to wake up and to take a look at what was right in front of us.  The sphere started to slowly move west across the road.  It kept an altitude relative to the slope of the hillside covered with houses, as this area is heavily populated.  It moved slowly out over Lake Washington.  When it was a few hundred feet out over the lake, it again stopped and hovered for a few seconds.  At arms distance the size of the object was relative to the size of a basketball.  The color was about the same as the blue of propane or natural gas when burning.  It made absolutely no sound.  At this time my wife was witnessing the event as well as I was.  Then suddenly the sphere slightly expanded and then rapidly shrank into a pin sized dot that lasted for a second or two, as it vanished with incredible speed to the North, almost as if it just disappeared.  We were both speechless for a few seconds and then we verified with each other that we both saw what we saw and could not put any logical explanation forth to name this as a natural earthly happening.I no longer feel like I need to suppress my feeling about what we saw that early morning.  I know I have seen something like all of the others that have reported seeing something similar.

I had watched it for 3-4 sec to realize it was a black (air)/ship/craft/thing (not stars) flying over a broken sky.To my amazement, it was a typical V shape, more like a Christmas tree V shape, rather than a B2 stealth bomber.  It was more like two converging rows of lights in a V formation, moving swiftly over the entire sky in mere seconds.  A few second later, a subtle low hum, much like a jet at high altitude,  the way you would ear it on a quiet farm.After thoughts: I saw it right above me, between two low clouds.  Altitude was IMO, for a craft the size of a Airbus 320, around 6 thousands feet, and with speed over mach 1, (really quietly), north bound.  The sound could not have been another high altitude jet, cause we can hear many every -quiet- day. I remember my surprise to ear such a low and distorted sound. Much like one of a quiet multi engine jet...End report.I think it is ours.

20100601,20100601," Ventura, CA", light,10 minutes,"I saw a red and white flashing object that moved in any way other than a straight line, and I think it noticed me.Before I tell you what I saw, or what, at least, that I can remember of what I saw on May 27th, 2010, a short while after 10:00 p.m, latest being 10:20 p.m., I want to let you know that until recently I was a total skeptic.  Before all this chit-chat about ancient aliens and ufos started on t.v. and what not, I thought, &quot;Okay, well, I agree that it&apos;s a possibility that there are other life forms out there, but I disagree that they have visited us.&quot;  Then came all the ufo hunters and t.v. series that have sparked an intriguement inside me.So, now let me describe my sighting to you.Okay, I&apos;m walking my boyfriend to the top of my street from where he will skateboard home, we say our goodbyes and depart.  About this time everything is seemingly normal.  As I&apos;m walking, being a nature lover that I am, I&apos;m looking towards the sky.  And I thought, &quot;Wouldn&apos;t it be crazy if I saw a ufo tonight? Walking home and I see one, yea right hahah&quot; sort of joking about in my head. Well, a few minutes later I notice something that first I thought was a star.  However, it had a white and red flashing light system.  The object would glow a dim red, and then a bright white, and then back to the dim red and then back to the bright white, like a strobe light, then I thought that&apos;s strange, so I stopped walking.  And that&apos;s when I noticed that this object was moving in abrupt directions, such as zig zagging, but this object was very far away so I could only see it move just a little bit everytime it did so.It was only a little light in the sky flashing a dim red and then a brighter white and moving in every other way I can think of asides a straight line.  Okay, here&apos;s where things get even a little more funky, so I&apos;ve stopped and I&apos;m looking at this light in the sky and I think &quot;Oh well, there must be some logical explanation for it.&quot;  So I keep walking, not a block away from my apartment, I turn my head to face in front of me and I noticed that far away up in the sky, is ANOTHER one of these flashing lights, still red and white, so I look back at the spot that my eyes had just previously left and sure enough the same one is still there.  I felt a bit frightened at this point and hurried into my home through the back door because I felt that it hid the view from those points of mysterious light, from what might&apos;ve been aliens.  Now there is one critical detail that I have left out, and that is that while I was walking, the light that I was watching, moved from in front of me ! to behind me.  It was originally ahead of me and off to my right, then it moved to behind me and off to my right, had I turned around and faced it, it would have been on my left.  I cannot explain it any better than that.In one or two sentences, I was walking home the other night and noticed two objects that were distant from each other in the sky yet had the same flight patterns and dual red/whtie light systems that were definitively not airplanes and not helicopters.  There was no sound, it was as simple as this, when I laid my eyes on it I knew it was something I had never seen before, and it frightened me.  I&apos;ve seen video recordings of such orbs of changing light and the best way I can tell you what it was, is a red and white ufo like all the other ufos glowing a bright white light and some other color.  I&apos;m saying that it is a possible UFO abduction case because soon after I went to bed, they might&apos;ve beamed me up late at night.  Also my boyfriend had a dream about me being abducted by aliens.  And when I think back to that night, things always get a little blurry, and everything that I said to you I remember with specific detail.  When it comes down to it, I think I might propose that! aliens are trying to make me forget, but I&apos;m holding onto it, almost like when you try to remember what you dreamed last night, and you can remember those bits and pieces of imagery but not the whole scenario.",

With only my own perspective to judge from I couldn&apos;t accurately determine the objects distance from me and therefore couldn&apos;t figure its speed or altitude but after watching it for a couple minutes I realized that it was either much too large and traveling much too fast to be anything conventional or it was flying much too low over the city.

Speaking with the neighbors they also said it looked like a lantern in the sky but it was not on a slant toward the earth but instead flying.  We have no idea what it is and have never seen anything like it,

These bright white starlike objects were in triangle formation, flying low with a sort of tilt or plane to our view that sheared the shape of the triangle. The objects then appeared to get much dimmer as they appeared to move at an alarming speed ascending, silently and maintaing perfect triangle form. Now also more at a perpendicular plane to our view as it ascended, this triangle was a perfect right triangle, it ascended slightly northward and completely zenith out of our view due to our own rooftop. Whether it left the atmosphere is something left to question.My wife and I chased out into the streets to see if we could still see more, but other buildings and canopied trees blocked our view.",

20100602,20100602," Tempe, AZ", disk,5 minutes,"Saucer shape, flying over Tempe, 6-7 white lights making a pattern as flew south. June 2, 2010 at apx, 9:10pm.I live near Rural Road and University, in proximity to ASU&rsquo;s Tempe campus.  As two friends of mine were leaving, one got in his car and drove off, the other called for me to quickly come over and look up.  As we can only see the &quot;aircraft&quot; from one angle, below us, the object was a circle shape, so likely some kind of saucer/disk.  It&rsquo;s altitude was near what typical, large commercial passenger planes reach as they are approaching landing, near Mill Avenue bridge.  The aircraft proceeded to head mostly south, in a slightly west direction.  When I witnessed the aircraft, it appeared to be 1-2 miles from me, over head.  It silently floated in the sky, as it traveled down over the rest of Tempe (until it was out of my sight).As my friend and I were watching it slowly drift away, another neighbor came outside to go to their car as well.  We called to her immediately, notifying her if she wanted to see a UFO to come quick.  She came over and watched with us, as she called her roommate to come outside.  By the time the roommate (4th witness) came outside to meet us, all he could see was the red light in the far distance (unable to tell the difference between this and another local Sky-Harbor related aircraft).To describe the object:  It had no color, maybe black, and had a red light at the tail of it that occasionally turned quickly on and off (slight flash). The front lights were a series of lights, between 6-8 white, circular lights that were all on, but one. This is hard to describe, but one light would turn off, in the row of lights, and turn back on as the next one turned off.  It repeated this pattern, across the entire row, and back again.  Resembles the kind of lighting effects that are used on games we see at the fair, or Peter Piper Pizza, for example.As I have lived in direct sight of Sky Harbor&rsquo;s flight path for landing/taking off over the last 4 years, I have watched aircraft during the day and at night time.  I know what helicopters look like, and how aircraft are supposed to have one red and one green light (to indicate which direction they are flying to other aircraft) and this did not have these lights.  Like I said, the only red light was at the tail. The object moved slowly, similar to that of a police helicopter, using their search light to find a criminal.  The bright white lights making a pattern, as the object flew, was very usual, let alone unsettling.  The object made little sound, very slight puttering sound, but almost nothing at all.I am a 21 year old female, just graduated from ASU.  The other observers are one male, 22 year old, current ASU student.  The other witness, another resident at this apartment complex off 8th street and Dorsey, is about 19-20 years old.

At first I thought it was a star, but  it moved in closer and it appeared to have a hazy glow so I went inside to get my binoculars.  While I was inside the object moved somewhat closer. The object  looked like a top that young children use to play with.The tips of object both top and bottom extended to a point the middle was of course round but the strange thing was the object was encircled in fluorescent reddish orange light that lined the whole object. It  had squares throughout the top that were set apart from each other in equal size. The squares looked like windows and/ or small rooms with white flat pads on the bottom of the squares or rooms. I saw nothing but light in the squares and the round pod or pad on the botton of each square or room - I saw nothing move inside the windows the squares were empty with bright light shining throughout each square.

20100602,20100602," Green Bay, WI", unknown,30-45 seconds,"Orange object seen moving across night sky.  Did not have a trail, nor did it fragment, explode, or change sizeOn Friday 28MAY2010, a friend and I were visiting a third friend at his house in Green Bay.  The residence is located just southeast of St. Vincent Hospital  (The hospital is visible from the backyard).  This residence is on the east side of Green Bay, approximately 3 miles north of WI-172, and 3-4 miles east of the Fox River (Distances are rough estimates!)   At approximately 10:10 PM, the three of us were sitting on the back deck of the house.  I was sitting on a bench at the edge of the deck and right next to the house, facing north-northwest.  Friend #1 was sitting directly to my left, facing due North.   Friend #2 was sitting on a picnic table in the middle of the deck facing us.  As we were talking, Friend #1 happened to look up in roughly northeastern direction and see something in the sky.He remarked &quot;Is that an airplane?  That&apos;s not an airplane!&quot;.   At this point, I cannot remember if he indicated the direction the object was traveling.  I could not see the object from where I was sitting because the house blocked my view.  I instinctively turned to my left and looked upward over my shoulder, where I was able to view a patch of sky not obscured by the house or the stand of trees at the edge of the property.  I managed to see the object as it moved.I saw what appeared to be an orange &quot;fire-colored&quot; object, very roughly circular, but nebulous in appearance, moving across the sky at a rapid clip. It was about as large as the thumbnail on a man&apos;s pinky finger, if held at arms length.  There was no trail or halo around this object, nor did it change size as it moved.Once the object was obscured by trees, I dashed for the west end of the yard, where the line of trees ended (about 15-20 feet past the end of the deck).  The object again entered my field of view.  Its characteristics had not changed in the few seconds where I moved my position.  The object continued on a straight-line course from east-northeast to west-southwest.  It did not change speed.  It did not appear to change altitude.  The object did not change color or size either.  Everything remained constant until it appeared to fade just before it left our available field of vision.  One characteristic of the object that struck me is that the center appeared darkened somewhat compared to the outer edges.  When the object disappeared, it did not flash, &quot;blink&quot; or explode, it just faded in about a half-second.The sky was clear that night. Despite there being a large volume of commerical air traffic in Green Bay, there was no air traffic sighted other than the emergency medevac helicopter that periodically flew in to land at the nearby hospital. I do not think the flight path of incoming planes intersects with the helicopter&apos;s usual flight pattern. This helicopter was not in the area during the sighting.As my friends and I discussed this object, we were of the initial opinion that it was some type of celestial body which entered and then exited the atmosphere.  However the absence of a trail, and the constant shape/size of the object are disconcerting when considering this theory.  Growing up in the country, I have seen my share of &quot;Shooting stars&quot;, meteorites, orbiting satellites, and what have you.  Most meteors I&apos;ve seen actually moved FASTER that the object in question.  The absence of trail is not all that unusual, but a meteor travelling at what appeared to be quite an oblique angle, visible for 30+ seconds, would seem to be large enough to expect to see a trail behind it.The entire event lasted about one minute, or one minute 30 seconds, from the time my friend spotted the object to the time it disappeared.Due to my uncertainty about what I saw, I am submitting this report with hopes that:  1) it can be compared to any similar reports submitted from 5/28/2010 or otherwise from Brown County/Green Bay  2) The experts at NUFORC can indicate the likelihood that this was indeed a meteorite or similar (re-entering satellite?) and NOT a UFO  Thank you for your accepting this report",

My attention was drawn to the sky in the southeast by a flash resembling a flare or a dud fireworks.  I became aware of a translucent object, a long, vertical rectangle with well-defined corners that floated north from the location of the flash. We are on Daylight Savings Time in Indiana and still have plenty of sunlight at that hour.  At first I doublechecked to make sure the object was not a banner being flown from an airplane, but the object had to be at least a mile from top to bottom. I slowed the car and got into the right turn lane and inched along.  The object, like a gigantic plastic film in the sky, kept moving north and was gradually assimilated or hidden by a darker cloud. I don&apos;t think this was a reflection of something on my windshield, because of the way the object moved, then remained stationary for a moment, even though my auto continued to move. I had to turn into a parking lot at tha! t point and did not see the object after that.((ADDENDUM FROM SOURCE OF REPORT))To the staff:  I filed a serious, legitimate report but mislabled the date of the incident as 5/01/10 instead of 6/01/10.

20100602,20100602," Humble, TX", triangle,5 minutes,"Triangular object hovering above tree tops.I witnessed an unusual object in the sky while driving home from work on March 20, 2008 at about 7:50 p.m.  The object was hovering above the tree tops of a wooded area near FM1960 and Moon Trail Dr.  When I first noticed the very large bright white light in the sky,  I was driving east on FM 1960 and was about 2 miles away from it.  I didn&apos;t think much of it as I thought it was an airliner on approach to IAH airport with it&apos;s bright landing lights on.However, as I continued to approach it, I realized that is wasn&apos;t moving, but hovering over the tree tops about two tenths of a mile off of the main road.  Also strange was the fact that despite a fairly clear evening, the object seemed to be shrouded in fog (too low for a cloud) and the large bright light began moving back and forth onto itself--more like a very large spot light.  Couldn&apos;t clearly see the object itself, but could see the light moving back and forth through the fog/vapor.  It was very large, 3-5 times the size of the largest airliner. It continued to hover as I passed it, and I turned off of the main road at first chance to get a better look.  The under side was also shrouded in fog that was illuminated by various small white lights with an overall triangular shape. There seemed to be a smaller platform underneath.As I turned my vehicle to try to follow it, it very slowly and silently moved off towards the north, just above the tree tops out of view.  From the back it looked like a dark rectangular object with 3 large white lights across the back. It was too big for a helicopter or an airliner. There were no other aircraft in the sky at that time. FM 1960 is a busy road and I&apos;m sure someone else had to see it, however there are often planes passing through there on approach to IAH.

I am going north bound on the 55 just about getting to where the 91 splits to the 91 east and west. As I am talking to my friend I could not keep my eyes off the ball of light that seemed to be hovering right smack in plain view. The first thing I said that must be a helicopter&hellip;  Then I started rethinking that idea because it just stood in one place for a period of time. I told my friend I think I am looking at a U.F.O he said record it and I said that is what I was going to do.. I pulled over three lanes on the free way and hopped out of my car. I looked at it for a min to make sure that it was not a plane or a helicopter. But then it could not explain why it just hovered over me and my car. It seemed really close now and I took out my phone and was not sure that it would be able to see it but I pushed record.  As I was trying to capture it on my phone cam, I noticed that the color was like a baby blue and bright ball of light. The way it traveled   I could only compare it to the patterns a lightning bug would use slow back and forth in a zig zag pattern.

It looked like it was coming down&hellip; I freaked out and jumped into my car still looking through a possible window that would let me see it.

20100602,20100602," Johnstown, PA", light,30 minutes,"Bright, orange (oval shaped) object over Johnstown, PA, flys for short period then remains stationary in sky for over 30+minOn Monday May 26, 2010,  my girlfriend and two children ( my oldest being 6 and youngest 2) decided to go get ice cream at a local creamery ,located at Roxbury park, in a section of Johnstown known as Roxbury.  After we got ice cream we proceeded to sit at some benches at the perimeter of the park and eat each of our ice cream desserts there.As we were beginning to eat the dessert My daughter (age 6) asked me , &ldquo;what is that light in the sky Papa?&rdquo; I took a look in the direction that she was pointing and noticed a very bright object approaching from a distance (It came from the direction of Westmont, another suburb of Johnstown) towards the direction where we were standing. (Note: The four of us were not the only ones out at this time of night.  There was another family, eating their ice cream desserts beside us as well. They did not seem to be paying attention to what we were looking at)  My initial answer to my daughter&rsquo;s question was that the object was a helicopter, possibly with a spotlight on. I mentioned the spotlight, as the light the object was emitting was extremely bright, orange, and looked like what you would see, if looking at a spotlight head from a distance. I stated to her that the helicopter was probably coming in for a landing at the local hospital (Conemaugh hospital).As I continued to observe the object, it came to a gradual stop. (Note: as it approached our location, it did not &ldquo;fly&rdquo; very fast at all, which led me to believe it was a helicopter)  We continued to watch the object and as time past, I came to the realization that it was not a conventional aircraft. The object remained stationary for a period of 30 minutes or more. (The length of time we were at the location eating our ice cream).I became perplexed as to what this object could be.  It was a pretty clear night, and many stars were visible.  This object however was in our atmosphere, much brighter then even the north star, or planet such as Venus, and after having seen it move initially, it remained stationary for an extended period of time.My girlfriend mentioned at some point during this event, that there was in fact quite a bit of  &ldquo;aerial&rdquo; activity in the vicinity of this object.  We both notice several smaller aircraft flying in what I call &quot;an observation flight path&quot; at various locations in the sky near to each other and in the direction of the object.I will say that after looking at the smaller aircraft for some time, and following their flight paths, At least one of the aircraft came to complete stop mid air and seemed to be observing the object that I am reporting on.  The smaller aircraft looked to be a &ldquo;conventional aircraft&rdquo;, as it had both white and red blinking lights. The only abnormal behavior that this small aircraft exhibited was the &ldquo;hovering&rdquo; maneuver it was able to do when &ldquo;observing&rdquo; the bright object.I will mention that I was able to take some photographs and video footage of this event with my smart phone.  As you may already know, the quality of this media is not very good. I also do not have flash on the camera, which definitely did not help my cause in attempting to capture good footage for the purpose of evidence. You are welcome to this footage if you so desire.After at least 30 minutes of observing the object, I packed the family in the car and took them home.  After being home for about 20 minutes, I decided I needed to go back to the location where I saw the object and ensure that what I saw was indeed not a star or planet.  When I arrived at the exact location I had initially seen the object, it was no longer there.  There was no aerial traffic either. The skies remained clear of clouds, allowing me to see the stars. This object was most definitely not a star or planet.",

20100603,20100603," Indianapolis (150 miles SW of), IN", light,2 minutes,"I saw a reddish colored orb that was &quot;observing lighting show thunderstorms&quot; &amp; it displayed 2 amazing climbs and a huge burst of speed.I was the captain, flying a four engine turbine powered aircraft (L-188) at flight level 230 (23,000 feet) inbound toward Indianapolis, Indiana, thence cleared to Ft. Wayne for the Detroit Star Ft. Wayne transition into YIP (Yipsilanti, Willow Run Airport, Mich.)  That&rsquo;s a  &apos;standard terminal arrival route.&apos;   I was on a heading of about 030 degrees.  Both my first officer &amp; flight engineer were doing other duties when I first spotted traffic at my 1100 position, 10 miles &amp; slightly below me.  As captain, I always kept the red instrument panel lighting at a absolute minimum setting so as to have the best visibility outside.  I first spotted a cranberry red light.  It appeared as if it were just another aircraft in the clear night sky, no shape or size, just a red light in level steady flight about 4000 feet below me &amp; 10 miles to my left moving left to right at a steady speed of about 400 knots, about the same speed I was doing.  The size of the light was just like any other aircraft&rsquo;s rotating beacon or light, but this was a constant steady light, not like a normal pulsating rotating beacon that aircraft are required to have. I noticed in was headed straight towards a large thunderstorm cloud that was at my 1 o&apos;clock position and 10 miles.  This thunderstorm had constant &amp; consistent in-cloud to in-cloud lighting strikes that really was lighting up the large cloud like a Chinese lantern.  The red light kept a steady 400 knot speed aiming right at the storm cloud.  Then when it got to within 200 yards of the thundercloud itself, the red light changed course from 110 degree direction to a 250 degree direction, instantly, still maintaining the constant 400 knot speed.  It didn&apos;t turn, like an aircraft makes a turn, it just changed course, instantly, like a curser on a computer is capable of doing when you jerk your mouse control quickly left to right. Now it was heading straight towards a long line of constant lighting thunder storms, or squall line, that was at my 9 o&apos;clock position and about 20 miles off my left wing tip.  As I watched the light move at a constant speed from my right to my left directly in front of me, it suddenly climbed at a perfect 45 degree up angle, leveled off for a about 2 miles and then climbed again at a perfect 45 degree up angle without any change in speed either time, to an altitude about 3000 feet above me.  It then turned slightly right to a heading of about 250 degrees straight toward a point just in front of the first of a long line of constant lighting thunderstorms.As soon as the red orb got established on the new heading towards the all lit up lightning squall line to my left, this red light went from its 400 knot speed to, I&apos;m going to guess between 2ooo to 3000 miles per hour for about one long second then it again immediately went back to its slower 400 knot constant speed again.  It covered that 20 mile distance in just over a second, someone should be able to turn that into a speed in miles per hour.  It didn&apos;t accelerate up to that speed and it didn&apos;t decelerate back to the slower speed again, it just made an instant jump from a slow 400 knots to a really fast 3000 knot speed, for just over a second, covering the 20 mile distance and then immediately back to the same slower speed of about 400 knots.  It was amazing to watch.  After being a airline captain for over ten years I have never ever, before or since seen an object under such obvious control that maneuvered &amp; changed speed instantly, at will, so they could maneuver to and observe the constant &amp; consistent thunderstorm light show display.I watched it make one more turn to its left, a heading of about 190 degrees so as to parallel this long line of constant light shows off to its right side.  It was then behind me to my 8 o&apos;clock position.  I brought the attention of my other two crewmembers just before the red light made its two 45 degree climbs, they saw that but couldn&apos;t see to jump in speed an jump back in speed because it was off to the left side of our aircraft.

One of the object, glowing red, moved quickly toward my house, above where I was standing. It hovered no more than 300 feet above me, and moved down the road.Later that night, at 3:00 sharp, my roommate came outside as I was coming in.  I told him what had happened, and we both began searching the night sky.  Seconds later, the shape appeared again, moving as it had before (very rapidly).  Within ten minutes, a series of flashes erupted from the east, without cloud cover (no lightning).  Immediately afterward, a dozen circular &quot;crafts&quot; emerged, traveling in perfect oblong triangles (groups of three), moving west at a decent speed, as though heading toward some planned destination.  It didn&apos;t take long before more and more of these groups emerged.  Soon enough, the sky was littered with these triangular groups.It was like looking at a sky filled with moving stars, but the stars were larger and far brighter, able to pierce through cloud cover.  After each wave finished, there would be more flashes of light, followed by hundreds of &quot;crafts.&quot;  Coincidentally, the flashing red craft I had seen earlier came bounding down towards us, but stayed at a decent height.  Tiny specks of light (or what looked like smaller crafts) broke off of the entity periodically.  This whole process lasted two hours, or until 5:00 am.  All in all, I would say that we saw approximately 1500 anomalies.I realize how outlandish this sounds, but I am being quite honest, and only wish to help people understand the gravity of the situation. I can only share my subject feelings on the matter, but from the looks of it, each anomaly was being piloted, taking non linear paths, some turning around completely.  At one point, when all of the cloud cover vanished, the crafts froze simultaneously and took on the patterns of constellations, i.e., Orion&apos;s Belt, the Big Dipper, etc., as though to camouflage. The flashing red anomaly also emitted a strange pulsating noise, very quietly; however, only further examination of the envirnment will tell if this is somehow connected.I hope this happens again tonight, as I will be patiently awaiting.  I am serious in admitting that something very big was (or is) going on.

Still skeptical, I observed and noticed the sphere ascending slowly to the south at a steady rate.  A faint fuzziness existed around its perimeter. I photographed the sky using a blackberry camera phone such that each frame should encompass the sphere.  To my amazement the object passed behind a thin but opaque cloud during the observation period.  This then confirmed that it was much higher and further away than a mylar balloon or facsimile.  The object maintained its altitude (estimated ~2000-3000 ft).  The presence of numerous jets landing and small private aircraft preclude the notion of a misidentification of a plane as a black/opaque sphere.  Six images were taken as it progressed southward to ultimately disappear.  I am posting this observation in response to seeing NUFORC reports of similar  in the vicinity.",

Anyway, while on the flight deck on a very bright night an oval shiny UFO appeared out of no where, it was green yellow and bright.  It did not look like anything I have ever seen in the skies, when it appeared it looked like it was right on top of us but very high in the night sky, it stood there for about 40 to 50 seconds as if it was watching us.  Myself and the others were just speechless, none of us said a word all we did was look up in amazement without a sound then an amazing sight happened, as it came out of nowhere it left the same way only this time we witnessed how it all happened.  In a fraction of a second there was what appea! red to be a rapture in space, it looked like a door way to a different place in space, and just like that, the bright green yellow object was sucked in that door way and vanished it happened very very fast but all of us could see that, once the object was sucked in, the rapture closed behind the UFO.  I swear this is true and I have no reason to make it up I just thought  I share this event with the rest of the world.

I was with a friend. The sky had bouts of moving clouds.  Sometimes the clouds were more dense, and sometimes the sky would be pretty opened up.  I soon noticed a very bright star, there weren&apos;t any others noticable in the sky.  It was abnormally bright, and it was moving north in the sky.  It felt much too distant to be a plane, and there was no sound.  I asked my friend what he thought of it. He said he wasn&apos;t sure, he thought it was probably a satellite and fell asleep.   I&apos;ve never seen a satellite before, but this &apos;star&apos; looking object then stopped and stayed in one place, making small seeming motions back and for or up and down.  This object would fade in and out sometimes, other times it would get covered by clouds and it made it difficult for me to understand what it really was. After observing this one object, and noticing others over a matter of a half hour to 45 minut! es, one single, low flying plane, flew through the sky right in the vicinity that I was watching the object. I felt as though someone else saw this and was investigating the situation. This was the only airplane I saw in the sky from my location that night. Not long after that, I saw the most facinating thing I have ever seen.  A reddish, hazy, round sphere, less than a quarter of the moon in size came from nowhere from the lower left side of the star moving to the right, and flew at a very fast speed in front of the clouds across below the star looking object, and immediately moved south, in front of the clouds, but still feeling pretty far away. The experience lasted about ten seconds and then it disappeared. My friend soon woke up, and we left. I can&apos;t really remember much after the red sphere, I know the sky cleared of clouds, and some stars were visible. It became more difficult to tell what were stars and if the star like object was sitting among them. I was pretty ove! rwhelmed.",

Bristol Mountain ski resort was teaming with activity for the holiday weekend, that&rsquo;s when we really used to get snow.I worked in the snack bar on the bottom floor of the Ski Lodge, along with 4 other people present that day.  We cooked Hamburg&rsquo;s,  hotdogs, fries and such for customers visiting the ski resort.The only window&rsquo;s in the snack bar area were a row of windows located higher up on the wall just below the ceiling, facing the Mountain across the street from Bristol Mountain ski resort.  These are the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, in the finger lakes region.It had been a busy day this Saturday November 26th, 1977.  Lunch hour was packed.  Finally the business dropped of for the snack bar and we were all just goofing around and talking, when one of the guys I worked with yelled out,  &quot;Hey , look at this thing across street above the Mountain!&quot;  So we all looked out the window&rsquo;s to see what he was making the big deal about.There was a perfect view of this object above the tree line of the Mountain across the street.  At first you had a hard time seeing it because it was a beautiful sun filled winter day with a dazzling blue sky.  It was like a bright orange yellow glowing severe triangular craft, with like a boomerang back to the triangle, but the craft had a severe point to the front of the triangle like to a sharp point and the back although it had a boomerang shape was not a wide type.  It looked like the shape of a paper air plain you made in school.It was just  sitting still over the Mountain top and was pointed right at Bristol Mt. Resort.  Like it was observing all the activity going on there.  We watched it for sometime until we started getting busy again, and after that point I don&rsquo;t remember if it just left or what?   Over the years I have told this account to different people at parties and such and always can remember it with clarity.  I was completely blown away while surfing the internet, when I discovered that these triangular crafts have been seen by many people.((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))",

Then I saw green light shining down.  I thought it had to be some strange lightening, but there was no other lightening in the sky.  It was shining through a spot in the clouds exactly like a spot light.  It was clearly very green in color.  We tried to capture it on cell phone camera, but it would not show up.  When we watched the video the screen flashed white a couple times.That was probably about ten miles north of Bismarck on hw 83.On approach to Bismarck we saw three amber/orange/red colored lights above town.

It was then that I asked my mom if she saw the light and she said yes and had been watching it too.The drive was about 20 minutes and the road was fairly windy, and the entire time, the light continued to travel the same path as we did.  It also seemed to bigger, which I assumed meant it was getting closer to our car.  When we got close to our house, we turned left into our neighborhood.  It was then that the light came even closer to our car, then moved ahead of us about a block down the street and hovered. It was very low in the sky, almost to the top of the tree line.  By now, we are both scared.  We drove down towards it, and made another left onto my street. Our house was two houses on the left.  We pulled into our driveway and my mom ran inside the house to get my dad.  It was at that point, the light suddenly went from white to several bright flashing colors, yellow, white, red, blue...

I was eight years old and my parents and I were visiting their friends, somewhere rural outside of Toronto.  Not exactly sure of where but it would have been in the GTA, summer, late in the afternoon. As the only kid there, I was told to go play outside. The backyard was a large grass area, with large trees( pines and such) and wooded areas around the perimeter of the property.Anyway, I saw a movement in the sky and looked up. Gliding through the air was a ring shaped object. Not a disk, more like a substantial wedding band, with tall sides but a hollow narrow body. There was no noise, no smoke, no vapor. It was moving quite slow and low, maybe twice the height of the tree line.  The outer side of the &quot;band&quot; was black and had little white dot lights on it, similar to an electronic score board.  The ring itself did not appear to be spinning, but the white dots seemed to be scrolling around  and changing their configuration, but nothing that I could read.  The little dot symbols seemed very simple, just randomly changing and moving around.  There was no discernible front or back. It just quietly glided past with nothing changing other than the dots.  I watched it quite calmly for about 30 seconds and then it went past the treeline and I couldn&apos;t see it anymore.I then went in to get everyone to come out to the front yard to see if we could still see it.  The adults weren&apos;t that interested in my rambling about a spaceship and when I went back outside, of course it had not reappeared.Being 8 at the time, I don&apos;t seem to have a good grasp of the size. I seem to recall it being small, maybe 15 to 15 feet across. I remember thinking that it had to have very small spacemen or that it was being controlled remotely, being that the shape didn&apos;t seem like anyone could be inside. But who knows, maybe it was bigger than I remember or maybe they were really really small, lol.Over the years I have wondered if it was some sort of remote controlled aircraft or weird balloon, etc. but it just doesn&apos;t seem plausible. It was definitely flying, with no noise, no vapor, no strings and looked like a simple band horizontally gliding above the trees.

It did not have a tail, nor did it shoot high across the sky and fade away.  Meteors are fairly easy to track because they consume more distance in the sky than this object.

People are stuck on life can not live in space because of the lack of atmosphere and exstreme cold temperatures.  Drop this theory and it all makes sense.  There are creatures that come and go in our atmosphere.  I say this because iv&apos;e seen them.  These were not your everyday earth inhabiting animal.  Flying in and out of a cloud.  My math is right on.  These were swooping at speeds excessing 500 mph. These were living things and not aircraft.  Nor were they alien aircraft.  These were living creatures flying in our SKIES........And yes I would like to talk with one of you.

What we saw was a series of lights flashing one by one in a line which would disappear after one or two series of flashes only to reappear at a different location from where we last saw it. Also for each of the series of flashing lights, whatever the lights were attached to was distinctly hovering in one place.  There was no tracking light that all planes and helicopters have.  After about six or seven times of it reappearing and disappearing, it finally disappeared behind the trees.  The night sky was clear to the point where all of the stars were visible.  In fact, in a different part of the sky a plane was also visible which provided a point of comparison.  The plane seemed to be significantly smaller and the only light it was giving off was the flashing tracking light on the belly of the fuselage.  The series of lights given off by the UFO, while far away, were especially bright.  I have been a UFO skeptic for my entire life, but after racking my brain for a full day I cannot come up with an explanation for any current aircraft that behaves like what we saw last night.",

I am currently a student in the medical field and I had to be at the hospital by 5:30 am that morning.  It was still sort of dark out, enough that I had to turn my headlights on.  There was no wind. The sky was clear, no clouds were in site.  I got in my car around 4:50am, started it and waited for it to warm up. I live in a normal neighborhood in the south east part of the city.  As I was backing out of my driveway I happened to look up in the sky out of the driver&rsquo;s side window, which would have been towards the west.  I saw a fairly small whitish light about 45-55 degrees above the horizon in the sky.  It almost looked like a star.  When I first saw it I did a double take, when I fixed my eyes on the object it looked like it was moving around very fast and then it stopped and hovered for a few seconds.  After that I started driving west down my street still looking at it through the front windshield of the car.! It was moving very slowly.  There were no flashing lights, or blinking lights like those on an airplane or any other man-made aerial craft.  As soon as I got to the end of the street at the stop sign I stopped and got out of my car and was watching the light slowly travel north north east at a fairly slow rate, slower than any airplane could fly without crashing.  When I got out of my car and looked up at the object it was pretty far away, but it almost looked like there were 3 lights in the shape of a triangle.  They appeared to be kind of close together, like it was a single object, not 3 flying objects in close proximity.  For a few seconds I was pondering driving back to my house to grab my video camera, but I didn&rsquo;t want to lose sight of it as it was traveling away from me.  (Later that evening I checked to see if my video camera was even charged and it wasn&rsquo;t.  I am always going to make sure it is from now on at all times.)  I was parked in front of a neighbor&rsquo;s house long e! nough for someone to turn on their front porch light.  I don&rsquo;t ! know if they saw me and was wondering what I was doing.  I didn&apos;t want them to call the cops thinking I was a prowler or anything so I got back in my car and watched the object moving away from me slightly increasing in speed. I backed the car up back towards my house so I could try to see it as there were trees blocking my field of view and I gradually lost it in the sky due to the sun starting to rise over the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range.  Like I said I know what I saw, and I saw something that wasn&rsquo;t man made. It looked like it had 3 small lights in the shape of a triangle and they were white. I am not a liar.  I consider myself very credible.  I teach at a local high school, and I am also a student in the medical field.  I have also seen several other unknown objects in the sky over my lifetime.

I was driving and my wife says &quot;do you see that?&quot; and i said &quot;see what?&quot; and she pointed straight ahead and a bit up and off in the distance by many many miles.  I saw &quot;the sky&quot; moving, at least thats what it looked like for a second.  I pulled over to the side of the road and we got out of the car.  At first it looked like some lights flying in the same direction but then i realized that a lot of stars were not visible and then visible...something HUGE was flying back and forth across the sky, it was blocking out HUGE swaths of stars at a time.  Then we noticed there were 2 of them!  Triangular in shape, we could see the &quot;nose&quot; lights of each and they had lights on the ends of the &quot;wings&quot;.  I can&apos;t describe to you how incredibly huge these were.  The ship that was in the lead position was larger than the one behind, but not that much bigger, just a bit.   We watched them fly left to right, back and forth for about 10 or more minutes and basically we couldnt believe what we were seeing.  I went back to the car to turn on the radio to see if anyone was reporting on this, but nothing.   We got back in the car and kept driving even though the ships were still there and flying.  I stopped watching them since i had to drive, but my wife kept looking.  Then she says &quot;oh my god&quot;.  I am like, &quot;what?&quot;   She says &quot;a bluish-white light just appeared in the sky and they (the ships) vanished&quot;.  I was like &quot;no way&quot;...and i looked where they had been and sure enough, they were gone, just starry sky was there.  Weird.  So we kept driving.  About maybe 5 minutes or so later my wife says &quot;there they are again&quot;.  I was like &quot;jesus...what the hell&quot;.  So i stopped again and we got out to see.  Once again the 2 big triangle ships were blotting out most of the sky but this time some kind of orange colored orbs were WAY up in the sky and floating in mid air.  They pulsed in color, yellowish orange, and there were 4 of them spaced out (i could not say how far because i had no spacial references).  Anyways, one of them dropped down lower than the others and appeared to be getting larger, and indeed it was rapidly coming closer to where we were even though it had to still be miles away.  We had our dog with us and he was barking and seemed pretty nervous at this point and i really didnt know what to do.  I thought maybe we should go back to the car but we just kind of decided to stay on the road and watch.  It stopped probably a mile (guessing) from us and was very very low to the ground. Then it hovered a while and went back the way that it came. Then (sorry this story is so long) we were about to get back in the car when we heard a plane coming from behind us (northeast) and it was moving so fast it had to be a fighter jet, we could see the lights on the plane also even though it was pretty high up in the sky.  It was flying super fast towards! the glowing light orbs and the big triangle ships.  The damnedest thing, we saw the plane fly (from our vantage point) right close to one of the orb things and the plane blew up.  We saw it explode and drop out of the sky in flames but there was no noise, although it was far away and we thought maybe thats why we couldnt hear it explode. So at this point i am thinking that there is NO way that we are the only ones seeing this whole thing unfold, so again i check all the radio stations but still nothing.  We both were trying to decide if we should keep driving south towards phoenix or stay away...and we decided to keep going.  As we got closer and closer to the city, the lights of the city made it impossible to see anything anymore and that was it.  I don&apos;t know what it all was but it was not possible for something that huge to fly like that and i still have no idea what it was.  Thanks for listening.",

The best sightings I had were when I lived in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  My boyfriend and I were walking into the mall on night and I noticed an unusual light in the sky and we decided when we left the mall if it was still there we would go look for it.  When we came out it was still there but had moved slightly.  So we drove up to Hyde Park where the lookout spot is and could see a disk like object hovering above Santa Fe.The sightings I am reporting now are above Taneytown, MD.  I have not lived here long but since I have moved here I have been noticing different things.  Last winter I saw a falling object over a local park, it was too large to be a falling star.  I have noticed an object that travels parallel with a main road- the lighted object moves so slow it is almost not noticeable it is moving unless you are actually watching it.I have also noticed that around 9pm there is a light in the sky behind where we live.  To give an idea of the diameter; stars vs. &quot;the light&quot;   it is like the stars are pin-heads and &ldquo;the light&rdquo; is a pencil eraser.  The light is not directly above me when I see it; it is off in the distance a bit. To show attempt to express the distance it travels within an amount of time; if you were to go on my back porch with a ruler and hold it up, the bottom of the ruler lined up with the roof top of the house-- the light starts out about 12 inches above the house diagonally behind us, then by 10pm the light is level with the chimney top of the same house.  Not sure how else to explain it.  The light is not directly above the house it is off in a distance.  Just using perspective to explain how it moves.  Also it does not move in a straight line &ndash; it slowly zigzags as it moves forward.  My friend and I went looking for it the other night but it was slightly cloudy out and lost it.  We a! re going to attempt it again on another night.  This light is out there every night &ndash; but I have not noticed it on rainy nights because I don&rsquo;t go out there when it is raining.Earlier tonight I saw something in my peripheral vision above me out front.  It was a very large green glow shooting across the sky.

20100612,20100612," Topeka, KS",,,"Two orange lights traveling over Topeka.  They made no sound and appeared to be powered.I was sitting in my back yard facing straight south on Saturday 6-5-10.  I had been outside about 15-20 minutes and then at approximately 1:00 AM, still facing south, I spotted, at an altitude of about 45 degrees up, and just slightly to the west, two separate lights, side by side, traveling directly from north to south.  I ended up following one of the lights with a pair of 10x 50 binoculars, south, to an altitude of about 5 deg, just above the trees down the block.  By this time it was far off and very dim. The sighting, from beginning to end, lasted around 35-45 seconds.The objects made no sound,  jet, prop etc., completely silent.  No blinking, or flashing  lights. Magnitude was 2.0 to 1.0, approximately.  Looking through binoculars, the colors were a dim orange glow with no distinct lines and the shapes of the glows were rectangular with rounded over corners.  Through binoculars they were approx 0.25&quot; inch wide, maybe slightly larger and the position of the &quot;rectangles&quot; were symmetric to one another.  My first impression when viewing through binoculars was that they looked like sky lanterns as they start to burn low, when all that&apos;s visible is the glow from the lower part of the paper sack.  It was hard to tell, but the shapes looked like they were the bottoms of something as opposed to being the entire object.  I could see (with binoculars), a very faint reflection or distortion out in front of the orange glows.  This was dark in color and not a reflection of the orange light but more of a reflection or distortion of the night sky.  These &quot;refl! ections or distortions&quot; were extremely faint to the point of fading in an out of view.  Height of the lights could have been satellite altitude or as low as passenger jet altitude, but I couldn&apos;t be sure.  I do believe the lights were much higher than local low flying air traffic.  Speed appeared slightly faster than satellite speed.  Distance between the two objects, when I first spotted them, (extending my arm up, in front of me at a 45 degree angle and spreading two fingers apart) was about 3&quot;.I like watching satellite/Iridium pass over, so initially I thought I was seeing two satellites.  Movement of the objects appeared powered and were very fluid and constant.  They stayed perfectly fixed, side by side, traveling in a straight line like two fighter jets in formation.   They were definitely not something being carried on the wind.  There were stars between them so I know they weren&apos;t attached. I watched them like this, with naked eye, for a few seconds, but the lights looked different than satellites, not pin point reflections, but more of a dull glow, so I switched to my binoculars.  After a few seconds I began watching just one of the lights (the other light was outside the field of view of my binoculars) until it dimmed out of sight, so I don&apos;t know if the other object stayed beside it the entire time.  As far down on the horizon as it traveled, about 5 deg, I would think the other object would&apos;ve come into the FOV but I didn&apos;t see it.  The &quot;dull glow&quot; of these objects was dim enough that had they been the smaller size of the pin-point of reflected light given off from a satellite passover, I probably wouldn&apos;t have spotted them.  Because of their larger size, though, they were very evident to the naked eye.Night was clear, moonless, little or no breeze.I would be curious to know what these lights are, and someone else may be able to easily explain them, but in all my years of looking up, I&apos;m at a loss.  I thought possibly a couple of Stealth fighters, but then they wouldn&apos;t be very stealthy with the orange glow part.  Forbes Field, (Previously Forbes Airbase) is a few miles to the south, so maybe it had something to do with that.  I&apos;m not an expert, but I would think aircraft running lights would be required when flying over a city.Background; 48 year old male, some college education.

As I was crossing the I-44 overpass at Exit 100, I noticed a bright gold colored light to my left.  It appeared to be no more than 100 feet off the ground and less than a mile west of me.Hundreds of people reported sightings of mysterious lights in the nighttime sky in the vicinity of Northview, MO (I-44 exit 96) in 1992, and I personally saw lights from a distance many times myself, and spoke to others who saw things up close, but this was by far the closest I had ever been to it.As I traveled west on Missouri Highway 38 toward Elkland, I kept watching this object.  The farther I traveled, the closer it got to me and no matter which direction I was traveling, it was always at my 10 o&rsquo;clock position.  This was very unusual given the fact there were several 90 degree curves on this highway.  I could sense that I was being watched by whoever or whatever was in control of this object.  When it got to within a quarter mile of me, I decided to stop and look at it with my binoculars.I made a left turn onto Conklin Road, stopped and turned off my headlights and engine.  The object also stopped directly over Conklin Road about 1,000 feet west of me.  It was about 50 feet above the ground, totally motionless and soundless.  It was oval shaped and about 25 feet in diameter and approximately 12 feet from top to bottom.With my binoculars, I viewed the object for about 2 to 3 minutes.  It was the same color as yellow gold jewelry and had several black dots scattered randomly on it.  It also had a tiny bit of red on the very top I could only see with the binoculars.  It definitely was not a red light and it did not blink or strobe.The temperature that night was around 15 degrees.  I don&rsquo;t know if this had anything to do with it, but I could see a distortion around the object similar to what you would see rising from and asphalt highway on a hot summer day.The car I was driving was equipped with a spotlight.  While standing there looking at the object, I decided to aim the spotlight at it and turn it on and off a couple times to see what, if anything might happen.  After carefully aiming the spotlight toward the object, I turned the switch on and off twice in rapid succession.  As I was turning the light off the second time, without a sound, the object went straight west and was completely out of sight in less than a second.  This was the last time I saw the object.What was really strange about this was the fact the object did not start at zero miles per hour and gradually increase its speed, but instantly went from zero directly to something like 2 or 3 thousand miles per hour without creating a sonic boom.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of sighting is approximate.

At first we thought they might be parachutes, but they were hovering in the same position for too long. We also guessed they might be balloons.

They rose slowly and eventually formed a triangle before they slowly dimmed, one at a time, and disappeared.The appearance of the lights was a bright red, and must have been large in size judging by my estimated distance, minimum of 5-10 miles away, possibly further.  They rose very slowly, and not in a perfect linear line as a plane would climb as it gained altitude.  They seemed to exhibit a fixed x-y position relative to the ground, only increasing their z position (altitude).They formed into a triangle, and then began to disappear.These were not any kind of aircraft I&apos;ve seen a human have.

My estimate of the size of this object, taking into account the distance it was from my window, is that it was in between 10 and 30 centimetres wide and 120 to 200 centimetres tall.After throwing on some clothes and shoes I left my house and observed this object from the top of my driveway (~465m away). The object appeared to slowly float right to left parallel to the ground, at an estimated 5km/h.  It continued its course until it was obscured by trees that blocked my vision. The easiest way for me to describe the appearance of this object is to compare it to an oversized ruler.I have been trying to come up with an explanation of what I saw, and as such I have thought of a few questions already that readers of this report may want to ask, so I present to you some more facts:  There are no lights in my room that are green, or otherwise.I did not turn on the lights when I got up to go to the washroom, so this sighting couldn&rsquo;t have been caused by a reflection of light from my room, or my house.I did turn on a light in the washroom, but it is a dull 40w glazed bulb, and I didn&rsquo;t look directly at it, so this couldn&rsquo;t have been a case of after-images in my eyes created by looking at a bright light source while my pupils were dilated from darkness.I can&rsquo;t discount is the possibility of fireflies engaging in some sort of strange behaviour, as the colour of green was identical to the colour that fireflies produce. As to why these fireflies would /could behave in this type of behaviour is beyond me.I considered the possibility that someone could have had some sort of reflector /light/glow stick on the side of a bike, or on pants or arms, but this doesn&rsquo;t seem likely since the object was moving in what appeared to be only along the x axis from right to left, not up or down at all &ndash; contradictory to what one would expect to see if this object was affixed to somebody&rsquo;s leg or arms while walking.What do you think?

Tuesday sighting 6/15/10 total of 7 objects from 9:45 p.m. until we stopped watching at 11:00 p.m. (I verified my times with my cell phone call log); two large objects, one in the NE (a large round ball of light same as Sunday) and one to the West (a cigar shaped object with 3 lights that changed into on solid ball of light), 2 smaller flying objects were emitted from large object in the West, and 3 smaller flying objects were shooting around the large object in the NE.Object in the West changed shape and color from a cigar to a large round light and the colors changed from bright yellow to an amber orange.  Object in the NE (was the same both nights) appeared to be too far away so we could not make out a shape, it just looked like a round flashing object.  We could see lights changing colors from white, red, light blue-ish, and a slight orange color. I could physically see the NE object change direction in an almost erratic manner.  We got very excited about the sighting and were making a lot of noise and the object almost instantly stopped moving around. At approximately 9:50 pm a smaller object shot across the sky just under the NE object.  The smaller light came from the bottom right side of the large NE object and zipped across at an upward (45 degree) angle.  At approximately 10:10 pm another smaller object shot across the sky just under the NE object.  This time the object came from the left side and shot across to the right at a very sli! ght (20 degree) angle.  One more object shot around the sky shortly after that (approx. 10:40 pm) this time just a horizontal path just under the large NE object.  All three of the shooting lights were short bursts and in different directions that the others.  They did not follow the same path or direction.  The large NE object pulsated and slightly wobbled in the sky, as the time went by it appeared to go farther up into the sky, like it was going higher up so the light appeared to be smaller and farther away, but we could still see that it was pulsated very brightly (about 3x brighter than any star in the sky, and brighter than any airplane that flew by).  Both of the large objects pulsated.The other object in the West was cigar shaped when we initially spotted it.  It was hovering (directly to the right of the moon) in place and appeared to be suspended vertically with 3 very bright lights (changing from orange to yellow).  This object was much closer and lower than the other NE object. We have a video of this (W) object.  It was recorded from the back porch through the screen, and there was some debate about if it was an optical illusion.  However, we could see the cigar shape and 3 lights in plain sight, and I am absolutely sure that it was not an illusion.  We watched this object change shape (or appear to be different in shape) because the lights appeared to become one large light instead of the 3 single lights.  When this happened we ran out to the front of the house to watch it.  From the front of the house we saw this object change color and size (or brightness).  It moved across the sky in short, slow, erratic movements (up, down, side to side, and at angled, wobbling or dancing), and eventually found its place very low in the sky and drastically below and to the right of the moon.  It pulsated the entire time with very bright, large flashes to small flickering.  At one point the object became at least 3x brighter and appeared to be coming toward us.  Shortly after that the object dimmed down and appeared to be moving (slowly) downward again.  We finally went in the house at about 11 pm and we stopped watching.",

20100617,20100617," Cape May Courthouse, NJ", disk,several seconds,"dimly lit disc shaped object flying east to west makes a hard 70degree turn at unimaginable speedFirst let me begin by saying that what I saw last night is just one more in a long list of extraordinary flying objects I&rsquo;ve witnessed in the skies above where I live and where I work.  Last year I reported a sighting that three of my friends and I saw to Mufon.   However we were not taken seriously. I am aware that the Morristown Hoax has done a great deal to diminish credibility for all future UFO sightings in NJ, but I am not talking about seeing flares here.  I am a writer/researcher and one thing I discovered is that when our government wants to discredit a ufologist, they often create a hoax designed to lure UFO investigators into proclaiming the event is a genuinely unexplainable occurrence; only to have the rug pulled out from under them when the sighting is revealed as fake.  Morristown ruined the UFO hunters (on the History Channel) because the UFO hunter team went on national TV claiming that the sighting is undoubtedly real.  As soon as they did this, the sighting was proved to be hoaxed and the UFO hunters got canceled.  I feel I have to include this in my report because I think it is a big part of why no one seems to take me seriously.  Ok, on to what I saw last night. I am constantly sky-watching because I see so many unusual things up there.  I walked out my front door and looked up in the sky-facing east.  The first thing that caught my attention was a very quiet object with red strobe-lights.  I followed that for a second or two until a very dimly lit object flying west to east appeared in my line of sight.  This objec was shaped like a disc with two small wing-like appendages similar to the alien craft in the movie Independence Day.  The object was moving at an astronomical speed; faster than anything I&rsquo;ve ever seen.  It flew straight over my head, kept on its course for about 2 or 3 seconds and then pulled a hard 70 degree left turn, and began heading North at that point. There is a house to the east of my house only 20 feet away, so t! o follow the object I had to rush toward the end of the drivew! ay to tr y and get a better look.  Unfortunately by then the object was gone. The night before last, I saw a very similar craft, also dimly lit and flying at break-neck speed in the same general direction.  I have witnessed tons of other amazing airborne activity, which if you are interested and willing to take me seriously, I will describe in detail.  Some of the most outrageous sightings happened when I was with friends or my co-worker in one case.  So I know that I am not crazy, even though I have been forced to question my sanity based on some of the things I&rsquo;ve witnessed.  Also, I woke up a few weeks ago with a circular crater-like scar on my upper left thigh.  I don&rsquo;t know how it got there, but I can see that there is something hard under the skin, and extending from the center I can see what looks like spokes on a bicycle wheel. I did some research to see if others have reported the same thing, and I must say I am a little bit frightened by what I found.  I have no memory of how I go! t this scar, but I do know that one night it wasn&rsquo;t there and the next morning it was.  I really hope I&rsquo;m not wasting my time filing this report.  I just want some answers.  I am aware that most people go their entire lives and never see a single thing that could be classified as a UFO, and yet in the last year alone, I&rsquo;ve witnessed dozens.  Thank you for your time.",

I looked up and saw a HUGE sphere in the sky.  It was perfectly still, and made no sound.  I only looked up because of some birds--I wouldn&apos;t have noticed it otherwise--it blended almost completely in with the surrounding sky and clouds, but you could see the edges of it fairly clearly when you were looking straight at it.  It wasn&apos;t reflective at all, and I didn&apos;t see lights.  It was weird--I remember thinking it was almost like there was some kind of computer generated surface on the object that matched it exactly to the color of the sky and cloud cover, but you could see that the clouds didn&apos;t match up on the edges with the sky, and that they were moving a little differently than the real clouds.  I pulled my car over and got out to watch it for at least 15 minutes.  It didn&apos;t move.  I had my young children in the car with me--they had an after sch! ool appointment, so I had to continue on into Lincoln.  For the record, I know what a weather balloon looks like, and this was way too big and the wrong color to be a weather balloon.  I have no idea what it was, or how much longer it was there.

It was a bright white glow which appeared to be multiple lights with no colored lights.The speed and abrupt movement was nothing like I&rsquo;d ever seen.

My two parents and I saw it clearly for the duration of the event which lasted less than one minute or half a minute.  Four siblings saw the event and the other 3 were sleeping. It had to have been a weekend day because my parents would not have had us out that late on a week night.There was much commotion in the car and my parents, who were normally calm and serious, sounded alarmed and scared, which scared me.  The term UFO was not used; we all used the term &quot;flying saucer&quot; to describe it.  My father abruptly told all of us that we were never to speak of this again because the child welfare people would think they were crazy and unfit parents and take us away.  We never reported the incident to anyone.I mentioned it to my parents several years later in the 1980s and they both remembered the incident vividly.

20100618,20100618," Amarillo, TX", other,1 hour,"Craft shaped like a cube of bright swirling light, hovering over downtown Amarillo at 3:00 a.m., spot lights and heavenly music . . .After retiring to bed on a late Sunday evening in a cheap downtown motel room in Amarillo, watching television until I fall asleep, I tossed and turned until somewhere between 2:30 and 3:00 a.m., when suddenly a light flickered through the curtains.  I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention as I thought it to be a neon sign on the Bank of America building across the street.  I rolled over and attempted to sleep when the light again flickered through the curtains.  I still ignored it, and again with even more intensity the light flickered through the curtains.I reluctantly got up and moved the curtains so I could see where the light was coming from.  I looked up at the top of the Bank of America building of about 20 stories high and the neon sign was not flickering.  I was closing the curtains when I noticed what I thought was a police helicopter surrounded by bright lights. Spot lights were coming from the base and shining in various spots in the parking lot.  My first thought was that it was some kind of drug bust and the helicopter would be landing with a swat team.  However, the craft did not land, but stayed hovering high in the dark night.  Now it had definitely got my attention.As I focused on it, I made out the shape to be a cube, definitely three dimensional.  I couldn&rsquo;t make out any substance such as steel.  It was a cube of light, swirling bright light on a three dimensional cube.  I was still trying to rationalize what it could be.  I then remembered seeing special shape hot air balloons in Albuquerque which lit up at night in similar fashion.  &quot;That&rsquo;s what is must be,&quot; I told myself.  Then something even stranger happened.  I heard musical tones similar to wind chimes or ancient flutes that we often hear in Greek mythology type movies.  But the sounds were coming from inside my head even though it felt I was hearing them with my ears.I became afraid and did not move for about 20 minutes while I continued to watch.  I finally said to myself, &quot;What ever it is knows I am here, and I cannot hide from it.&quot;  I immediately dressed and walked outside.  I stayed underneath the 2nd floor overhang and peered out to see above.  It was even more magnificent when viewing through the night air although it was hard to focus on, somewhat blurred.  At that moment I was surrounded by an orchestra of musical tones again sounding like ancient flutes or pipes.  I thought to myself, how beautiful!  The song was child like, something you might hear a children&rsquo;s nursery.  Again, I heard the music in my head and outside, but not in our natural way of hearing, hard to explain . . .To make a long story short, I packed my bags and was running to my SUV when an early morning garbage truck and driver stopped in the alley next to my car. I looked at the driver in the eyes and signaled to look up with my eyes.  I turned and ran with luggage in tow, got in my car and drove two hours to my home in Lubbock.  I drove to my sister&rsquo;s office where my mother happened to be and told both of them what I witnessed.  By the look on their faces they were fearful for me.  I phoned a friend of mine who happens to be a deputy sheriff in Amarillo to ask if anyone had phoned in such a sighting in the early morning dark.  He laughed hysterically and said no, but would let me know if anyone did.  He did not call back.  I&rsquo;ve since moved to Phoenix and have told only a handful of people what I witnessed that early morning on June 20, 2005, five years ago.((NUFORC Note:  Source of report elects to remain anonymous.

While watching, we started to see one after the other traveling from west to east in the southern sky at about a 45 degree angle from where the moon was in the evening sky.  A very few were seen flying from east to west.  Those that were, were closer and almost looked like airplanes.  They were very bright.  We thought perhaps it was the sun reflecting off of planes however the closest airport is smaller and does not accommodate a large number of planes.  We started counting the objects and saw approximately 36 items.  When we had gotten to about 30 we saw a jet stream in the sky above one of the items.  You could see the stream but not the jet itself leading us to believe that the objects were possibly something other than standard airplanes.  A couple were closer than others and emi! tted a bright white light.

Through binoculars they were approx 0.25&quot; inches wide and the position of the &ldquo;rectangles&rdquo; were symmetric to one another. My first impression when viewing  when viewing through binoculars was that they looked like sky lanterns when they start to burn low, and all you see is the glow from the lower part of the paper sack, without the flicker of the flame. It was hard to tell, but the shapes looked like they were the bottoms of something as opposed to being the entire object. I could see (with binoculars), a very faint reflection or distortion out in front of the orange glows. This was dark in color and not really a reflection of the orange light but seemed more of a reflection or dist! ortion of the night sky. These &quot;reflections or distortions&quot; were extremely faint to the point of fading in and out of view. Height of the lights could have been satellite altitude or as low as passenger jet altitude, but I couldn&apos;t be sure. I do believe the lights were much higher than local air traffic height. Speed appeared slightly faster than satellite speed. Distance between the two objects, when I first spotted them, ( extending my arm up, in front of me at a 45 deg angle and spreading two fingers apart ) was about 3&quot;. I like watching satellite / Iridium pass overs so initially I thought I was seeing two satellites. Movement of the objects appeared powered and was very fluid and constant. They stayed perfectly fixed, traveling in a straight line, side by side like two fighter jets in formation.  They were definitely not something being blown by the wind. There were stars between them so I know they weren&apos;t attached. I watched them like this, with naked eye, for a few seconds, but the lights looked different than satellites, not pin point reflections, but more of a dull glow, so I switched to my binoculars.  After a few seconds I began watching just one of the lights (the other light was outside the field of view of my binoculars ) until It dimmed out of sight, so I don&apos;t know if the other object stayed beside it the entire time.  As far down on the horizon as it traveled, about 5 deg, I would think the other object would&apos;ve come into the FOV but I didn&apos;t see it.  The &quot;dull glow&quot; of these o! bjects was dim enough that had they been the smaller size of the pin-point of reflected light given off from a satellite passover, I probably wouldn&apos;t have spotted them. Night was clear, moonless, little or no breeze. I would be curious to know what these lights are, and someone else may be able to easily explain them, but in all my years of looking up, I&apos;m at a loss.  I thought possibly a couple of Stealth fighters, but then they wouldn&apos;t be very stealthy with the orange glow part.  Forbes Field, (Previously Forbes Airbase) is a few miles to the south, so maybe it had something to do with that.  I&apos;m not an expert, but I would think aircraft running lights would be required when flying over a city. Background; 48 year old male, some college education.

20100619,20100619," San Sebastiam (Spain),", formation,5 min.,"UFO formation over San Sebastian, SpainHi, I&apos;m writing this report to inform you I have a video of a UFO sighting recorded on a NOKIA N95 8gb cell phone.The video quality is not very good, since it is taken at night in the city, with the resulting light pollution, and the digital zoom to its maximum capacity. The recording is spectacular although the conditions of brightness and sharpness common to this type of devices.The video can be put under all kind of tests to ensure its authenticity. It is absolutely real.I do not want to avoid comments identify humorous or otherwise by known or not as well known. I hope you do not mind this detail.I&apos;ve got a Private Pilot License, and thank to my experience and knowledge about flying, and the knowing on attitude and maneuvers of aircraft on airspace, that&apos;s why I&apos;m absolutely sure that this are not &quot;conventional&quot; fixed wing aircraft. The only possible explanation would be that they were helicopters, but given the characteristics of air space location, time of sighting, weather and number of traffics sighted, it&apos;s hard to believe we&apos;re talking about this type of aircraft (and also due to other reasons explained below).Let&apos;s  describe the facts:  Location: San Sebastian, Spain Date: 06/22/2008 Time: 2:50 AM (local time)  The facts are set in a rainy late night, after a sultry day, classic Basque coast, in the afternoon that triggers a &quot;gale&quot; that completely changes the weather, thus passing a hot sunny day in excess , a late-night and early morning rain, the sky completely covered (the ceiling would be around 600 or 800 feet). Weather conditions certainly were not ideal, either for VFR (visual) or IFR (instrumental) flights.I leave a disco located near the mouth of Urumea river, 300 ft from the sea, and the first thing I see (outside the disco could at that time be about twenty people watching the scene) is something like flares or fireworks (is the first thing that went through my head just seen the objects).I never leave my amazement when I see that they are objects that have a bright orange light, fixed and weak (although the video appears in a flashing mode), which seem to be quite large, and maintaining a steady ascent flight (improper of a flare or firework).This is a sighting made up of at least nine traffic. I say at least it is the number of traffic which document the recording, but I am sure that before I started recording I could see more objects. I think there were around 13 or 15 spotted objects. I think this is a considerable number of traffics, which were moving in groups of 3 or 4, some in pairs and solo, with variable speeds from one another, although all were heading in an east-west direction, looking that its point of departure was off or the sea. I could not hear any sound coming from the objects (sound of rotors, ...). The truth is that my proximity to the disco would probably prevent me hear any sounds associated with them, but it is also true that in the case of many objects, it is logical that it had heard a noise, more so considering that the wind, even weak or very weak intensity, was at that time, and after the passage of the gale, north-northwest direction, so it was not a factor which prevented listening t! o sounds from that area, or that slowed them.The recording, in mp4 format and weighing 63.4 MB, has a duration of 4 min. and 25 sec., and has audio (with a &quot;taco&quot; or improper word included).I have to say it was something I could not believe. I was watching something that escaped my mind all logic by the circumstances of the moment, and physics of flight if we think of objects such as flares and fireworks. I had never seen anything like that. I have never spotted suspicious objects to be classified as UFOs but from my experience as a pilot and my knowledge of aviation, and from an objective perspective, I cannot give a logical explanation and some of what happened on that late night/early-morning of Sunday June 22nd on the sky of San Sebastian.Trying  to clear any doubts, I first put in touch with local newspaper &quot;El Diario Vasco&quot; once I got home (around 03:30 AM). From the paper, and to my question about whether they had received any calls or had known what had happened, they said no, and the person writing that I attended dealt with the subject telling me that I would have the exclusive on the matter. I did not provide any information in this medium, because my focus was solely on finding out what had happened, beyond creating a notice or cause any unnecessary minimum alarm.A few minutes later I put in touch with San Sebastian Airport with the intention of resolving any doubt in the case of several traffics had taken off from this airfield, which is unlikely since these facilities are operational only from 06:00 h. to 21:00 pm GMT. Indeed, a member of airport security personnel, along with several Civil Guard troops, at that time the only staff at the facility, tells me that since the closing time of the aerodrome there has not been any takeoff or landing operation. Thus, in the narration of the facts and seeking a possible explanation between the event, he tells me that there must have been a chopper concentration close to the field ... If so, that is, if it were private helicopters, where did they take off? at that time? in those weather conditions? how many? what was their fate? There are many questions, in addition to the already questionable as &quot;normal&quot; physical characteristics of the flight, since no one respects Training, traffic looking! each flight develops its sole discretion, even at times to provoke some kind of collision between aircraft. Also, the navigation lights are anything but navigation lights. They are more comparable to &quot;landing lights&quot;, although these are only used at final approach maneuvers, landing and take-off on, but that&apos;s not all, as the brightness, hue, intensity and very important direction of the light beam, not easily explained. Landing light beams are projected in a sense, the flight path, and not through a kind of focus light at an angle of 360 &deg; as in this case. In the recording can be viewed at all times the same intensity of each traffic light, regardless of their position, and throughout the flight path east-west.Thinking on the possibility that, being helicopters, were those well known and dilapidated soviet made MIL-MI that usually come from Eastern Europe to Spain for the summer fire season, I contacted next day with the tower of Labacolla Airport (Santiago de Compostela, Spain) for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was a landing operation of such choppers over last morning. The only reason for contacting with Santiago de Compostela Airport was that is the only one airport in the northern half of the Spanish peninsula, with the exception of the Foronda Airport (Vitoria), which operates 24 hours a day (H24 operational). The answer given by the driver in command at that time was negative, indicating that there was only air military exercises of NATO airspace early in the vertical drawn from Le&oacute;n to the west, there are therefore any flight plan or known traffic area in the hours watching the events. We are talking about a longitudinal distance between two points (San Sebastia! n - Le&oacute;n) approximately 160 nautical miles (300 km). We must take into account the rigor that military and civilian authorities established to determine airspace to such maneuvers, for the danger they entail implicit in the civil air operations.Given these responses, only have the option of consulting military authorities and the Radar Control Center in Madrid, Spain. Not being easy the access to these establishments, I leave it to anyone interested in the phenomenon of inquiring beyond the initial investigations carried out.All these details about the physics and flight characteristics of the objects spotted have been discussed with different Airline Transport Pilots of recognized national carriers, they can likewise view the recording made, and very surprised at what is seen in the same, have not been able either to give a priori any explanation of the phenomenon. Like me, they could give as valid only the explanation that they were helicopters, yes, with all the questions raised above.You can watch the recording at  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPUZuTwUmPE  Best Regards and thanks a lot!",

20100619,20100619," Cape May Courthouse, NJ", unknown,three minutes,"object with one flashing white light flying very erratically moves impossibly fast in impossible fashionThis is the second report that I&rsquo;ve filed this week, though I&rsquo;ve received no response to my first sighting report. I&rsquo;m curious to know if my first report was classified a hoax or a joke, and that&rsquo;s why it is being ignored. I mean I have far better things to do with my time than make stuff up. I read somewhere during the extensive research I&rsquo;ve conducted over the last year and a half, that a witness is more likely to be credible if he or she only ever files a single report; though credibility sharply decreases the more reports someone files.  The reason given is that UFO sightings are so statistically rare that it is highly unlikely a witness will ever have more than one UFO sighting or experience.  I can&rsquo;t say for sure about anyone else, but I know that in my case that for some reason the tiny patch of sky visible from my house, as well as once at my friends house and twice at my job last year, has been teeming with highly unusual activity.  Last night that act! ivity continued. I was outside over by my car that I share with my grandmother; whom I also take care of, and of course I was sky-watching. (I saw something 8 summers ago that has had me intently watching the sky ever-since)  I was facing north and looked over to my left(north by northwest of where I&rsquo;m standing) and saw something flying in an extremely erratic fashion. It had a flashing white light on it that for the most part was in one second intervals; though the pattern was somewhat irregular.  Every time the light would blink off, when it blinked back on the object had moved an insanely long distance.  But it wasn&rsquo;t simply traveling forward. It was moving forwards, backwards, diagonally and side-to-side. I&rsquo;ll put it to you like this. If this craft had a solid light instead of a blinking light, the pilot could have written its name just by maneuvering.   I&rsquo;m sure you are familiar with what happened at Stephenville Texas, right?  Yea it would have probably looked a lot like that.  I stood there and watched for about 2 or 3 minutes as this object darted around the sky the same way an electromagnetic charge instantaneously jumps from pole to pole.  If there was a human pilot flying this object, unless he is using some unknown super-technology, he or she would not have been able to withstand the G force required to make manuevers like this.  The oddest thing is that the object should have passed out of view; and if it was moving straight it would have. Instead it was moving in every possible direction, but never the same direction for very long.  Finally I just laughed and said to myself, &ldquo;show off!&rdquo;   The funny thing is that it isn&rsquo;t the first time I&rsquo;ve witnessed something very similar. Like I said in my last report I stopped filing reports after the first one to MUFON last year. No one is willing to come near NJ because of Morristown, but all that would be water under the bridge if I could just get an investigator with some high-tech cameras, video-recorders and infrared equipment to come down here and set up shop for a! night or two. Forget for the moment that almost no one sees stuff like this on a regular basis, because for once there is someone who really does.  I have a 141 IQ, am highly educated through collegiate and self-taught means and my vision is 20/15. I am a writer, work as a waiter, have an elderly grandmother to take care of, and absolutely no time to take out of my busy day to file a fake UFO report. Why would I ridicule a topic that I have extensively studied and found to be extraordinarily credible; based on things like the disclosure project, the Rendalshim Forrest incident, O&rsquo;Hare Airport, the 1951 incident where dozens of UFO&rsquo;s buzzed the white-house, the &ldquo;battle&rdquo; of LA, combined with what I have seen with my own eyes? I&rsquo;d give anything if someone would come down here with some good image-recording equipment because whatever is going on down here isn&rsquo;t normal, by any stretch of the imagination.",

It was around 3:30 am and my son and I were sitting outside visiting and talking.  I happened to look up at the sky in front of us and I noticed a very bright yellowish orange light shining in the southern sky.  My first thought was &ldquo;satellite&rdquo;, and to dismiss it, without calling attention to it. I glanced back at the sky and this light had grown a lot brighter and was also getting larger.  This confused me and I turned to mention it to my son when he said &ldquo;hey Mom!  Look at that light!&rdquo;.  I was about to tell him it was most likely a satellite when I saw that it had grown much larger (closer?), and brighter and was now not very far above the treetops.

20100620,20100620," Torrance, CO", fireball,10 min,"Glowing/reflective object clears coastline and makes odd movements around airport in Torrance CAFirst it is important to let anyone who reads this that I am someone who has always wanted to see the unknown. Therefore  I am always trying to debunk what my mind wants me to think.I live4-5 miles from the Redondo Beach coastline.  There is an airport &frac12; mile from my home, There have been a few times that a plane coming from over the ocean toward the airport seems to glow but I quickly figure out that it must be the sun reflecting off of the water and giving the appearance of a plane glowing.  The two times this has happened after a few minutes the plane looses reflection from the water and shows itself.Today however I was stumped. I wondered, not sure why, outside of the overhang of my carport and looked directly up beyond the airport airspace. I saw what I quickly thought was a plane that had caught  the sun that was behind me. My first thought was that this plane must be some aluminum shell picking up every possible reflection  it could to give the appearance that this plane was flickering with fire. The reflection was flickering like Morse code or something in that type of pattern.  The light moved at normal plane speed from west over the coast line to east about 5 miles past my location, slightly higher than 75% of the planes that come through this area.  Once it traveled far from me I expected the reflection to dim but it maintained it&rsquo;s glow well.  I was somewhat perplexed but I still felt it was a plane. At the 5 mile point past my location it turn upward and traveled to a greater altitude, before turning back at what appeared to be around the same speed as many of the! WW11 planes and sesna&rsquo;s  that decentin to the airport landing strip.  The glowing golden object came back past the airport heading west and then stopped it&rsquo;s westwardly movement. It help position for the most part in one area for the next five minutes.  There was some minor attitude changes but it maintained a very still and silent hold of it&rsquo;s position.  The moment it stopped movement I was not thinking plane anymore. I was able to go in my house twice to get my phone camera and my digital camera, both times when I came outside it had not moved and continued it Glowing flashes.I made one final dash inside my home begging my girlfriend to come outside, when I came out the last time the object was gone.Could it have been some type of metallic object like an aluminum balloon that appeared to be farther than it was, therefore it looked like it was traveling at plane speed and it just happened to catch the sun reflection and wind patterns that created its movement? I thought about that at certain point when I did not think it was a plane anymore but when I came out of my home for the third time after a 10-15 second absence the object was gone.  Before I went inside it was not moving at all and in 15 seconds it disappeared.I am not saying it was a UFO, but it was not something I could deduce, and going outside for noreason in the first place is a bit weird.Not one of the photos I took had anything on them except for blue sky",

There were no clouds, but there was some haze near the ground.  I noticed a light blue object approaching from the South which I at first took to be a satellite.  As I watched, I noticed it was moving much faster than any satellite I have ever seen.  The object continued going North, passing overhead slightly to the East of my location.  Suddenly the object went from medium intensity light blue to brilliant white, and its size seemed to increase substantially.  It was not a gradual transition as with an iridium satellite, but instantaneous, as it something had switched on.  About a second after it turned white, it began making a conical shaped wake which spread out from the object and dissipated.  The object itself began leaving a thin, white trail behind it as well. After several seconds, the brilliant white light, wake and trail went off, and the object returned to its lig! ht blue form.  After a few more seconds, it briefly switched to brilliant white again, but this time no wake or trail were visible.  The object returned to light blue and remained that way until I lost sight of it as it went behind the roof line of my house to the North.  The object was on a straight flight path the entire time, going from South to North.  It seemed to wobble a bit after it started making the wake and trail.  At the time of this sighting, there were satellites and various types of aircraft visible in the sky.  I did not hear any noise that seemed to be related to the object. I did hear jet aircraft but I am sure the source was from airliners passing overhead.  I watched the sky during the same time period for the next two days to see if it could have been some type of satellite, but I did not see anything similar.",

I stepped out in the back patio and reached down to pick-up the water hose when I came back up I saw what at the moment I thought was a kite.  I immediately concluded that the object was not a kite because it stopped moving but continued to rotate clock-wise.  I stood and stared at the object to study its form, color, &amp; shape.  This was the (MOST Obscure Object) I have ever seen&hellip; I also noticed that this object made absolutely no noise, and the most interesting aspect about it is its shape.  The object looked like a vertebrae or back bone and has it rotated it seemed to be flexing in a cumbersome motion. The color was a faded florescent blue, and the light that it emitted was even throughout the entire shape and form of the object. The size could have been 7-10 ft long and 2-3ft in diameter. The distance was about 40-50ft above me and facing north towards the Hollywood Hills. I ! wanted to go get my camera that was sitting on my desk so I backed away from the object to my back door keeping my eyes on it so I don&rsquo;t lose track of its position. I ran to my desk grabbed my camera and ran back out to my patio. The object was no-longer in its previous position, It had climbed vertically straight up at what I estimated to be 1-2 thousand ft. I turned off the LCD display on my camera to see if I can acquire it through the view finder. I could not see the object, but I snapped 4 succession pictures in the general direction of the object. I could still observe the object with the naked eye but could not see it through the camera. I continued to watch the object for about another minute &frac12; then it passed out of view completely. I then placed a call to the (LAPD) to file a report. The Officer who handled the call listened intently and asked me 1 or 2 questions, and then offered to send out a chopper that was in the area to see if they could intercept the object.! I said go ahead but that I could not see the object anymore s! o it wou ld be impossible for me to give any position of where it might be at that moment. The Officer thanked me for calling and said that it was an interesting conversation and that if the object returns to call again immediately. I then called (MUFON) but got no answer.  After that night I had tried to make sense of what I had seen that night and the only explanation I can come up with is that it could (NOT) have been anything explained in conventional terms and it seemed to be under intelligent control because it stopped in mid-air almost at the exact moment I took notice of the object. It was like the object was watching me has I was watching the object.  And when I returned outside this thing had traveled straight up vertically 1-2 thousand ft, from the point and position from where I left it to grab my camera. This was truly the most strangest sighting I have ever experienced&hellip; I have had an Abduction experience when I was 6 years old, and throughout my life I have had UFO sighti! ng of all different types, but nothing like the 1 I had this night. I did a little research into this object and there was some video on YouTube pertaining to a sighting that Story Musgrave the Astronaut had videotaped from the Space Shuttle. Here the YouTube video Link that will give some idea to what I witnessed: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jotdaXX1w2A The object I saw moved in the exact same way has the video clip of the Story Musgrave Sightings.

20100621,20100621," Hanna City, IL", cylinder,2-3 minutes,"Encounter with small UFO drone-type object This was an unusual encounter unlike any that most people describe. For the 13 years that followed, I assumed it was just a bad dream, that was until my Mother described having had witnessed something exactly identical that had also occurred to her 13 years prior, in the same location but on a different night.One evening in 1977, in a small apartment building in Hanna City, Illinois, I as a 5 yr old child, had been awoken to something that was incomprehensible and terrifying.  This particular night, I went into my Mother&rsquo;s bed to sleep which was not routine for me.Sometime during the night, I was awoken by a strange cylindrical, machine-like object. It was approximately the size of a coffee can, maybe a little bigger. It hovered 3 to 4 inches off the floor and spun silently as it moved around the bedroom. There was a slight glow around this object and it seemed to almost have intelligence about it.How it got into the building, I don&rsquo;t know. I was positioned on the right side of my Mother&rsquo;s queen-sized bed, and she was asleep on the left. She never awoke during my witnessing of this object. I first noticed it as it entered through the bedroom door on the right hand side of the room. It was metallic and appeared to have sharp edges. After it made its entrance into the bedroom, it hovered in front of the foot of the bed going right to left. I could see its glow cast just below the foot before it had emerged into sight. It then proceeded to come back and make a turn around the right front portion of the bed and slowly approached me along the right side of the bed still hovering/spinning approximately 3-4 inches off the floor. As it made its way to just below where I was sitting watching it, it ascended up to my level.At this point I was paralyzed with terror, I could not scream or move. I lost all consciousness and never had another experience like it again. I have no memory of what occurred after that, what it was, or why it was there.13 years later, when I was 18, the experience came up in conversation between Mom and I somehow, and I learned it was not just a dream. She had the exact, identical experience, same description, and same outcome as I did. Since then, we have been completely at a loss for an explanation of what it was. We have been trying to find other&rsquo;s with the same experience/sighting. I have a feeling it may have been some type of alien drone or probe, for it wasn&rsquo;t much like a ghost or apparition. I have read about hundreds of E.T. and UFO sightings, but nothing is described to like what my Mother and I witnessed.I have had only one actual, &ldquo;typical&rdquo; UFO sighting since that thing in the bedroom.  In February, 1994, at  Ft.  Leonardwood, MO.  Between the hours of 10:00 &amp; 11:00, on a clear day, there was a silver, diamond-shaped UFO in the sky moving in all sorts of sharp angular directions, and traveling from one end of the sky to the other in just fractions of a second, which must have been at least 200 miles ground distance. I had no other witnesses, but I was fully coherent and aware of what I was witnessing. It was visible for maybe about a minute, and it took off and disappeared from sight.I have no question about the UFO sighting in Missouri, for it seems to be like one of thousands of accounts. But nothing compares to the mechanical-cylindrical object that both my Mother and I witnessed on different occasions without knowledge of each other&rsquo;s experience of it. I would love to know if anyone has an idea of what it really was, what its purpose was, and why only my Mother and I had the experience with it. To this day, I&rsquo;m baffled but open to any explanation.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident in 1977 is approximate.  PD))",

Just past the village, it stopped then it just shot over the northern mountains in a split second. The object was 5 large lights in a V shape formation.  I could not see the object, due to the cloud cover, but you can tell that it was one solid object with 5 lights.  It was also very large as it hovered over the base, I can see that it was larger then the base! In a war zone no military air craft are to fly with lights on, and I know all of our aircrafts.

I&apos;ve had this event in my memory for many years, and I am wondering if any one can substantiate or add detail to what I&apos;m calling an event.I believe it happened between about &apos;68 and the early 70&apos;s.  My father worked as the attendant at one of the few all night gas stations along the old Rt 66 as it passed through Joplin, MO -- locally known as East 7th Street.  The station sat near the crest of a very long up-slope and so at night one could see back across the city quite well.  He was the introverted, serious type person.  Many of the local cops patrolling the city made this station a regular night-shift break stop and they shared all the &quot;cop gossip&quot; with him.  He stated to me the following when I visited on a weekend.One night he saw an illuminated metallic craft moving slowly just above rooftop level across the city.  The motion was steady and it exhibited a controlled motion.  It apparently did not come directly over the gas station.  This activity continued long enough for several police cars to engage in trailing the craft around the city, as he saw the roof lights on their cars in the distance and heard sirens.  He said that the craft eventually gained altitude and simply faded into the night sky -- there was no sudden vanishing, it just flew off very calmly.Later that same night, many of the cops converged at the gas station and began relating to each other what they had witnessed.  My father, of course, heard much of the chatter between officers and on the radios.  All agreed that they had seen a very large metal craft that simply glowed with no apparent source of light.  Some reported what appeared to be windows and various details about the skin, much as you might attempt to describe the surface of any vehicle after having been up close.After a few nights, the various cops on duty the night of the sighting resumed their regular break stops at the gas station.  All told my father a similar thing: They had all been instructed to forget that they had seen any thing and to speak no more of it.Dad said that the Joplin Globe Newspaper ran an article on the UFO as soon as they gathered the early police reports, but then the story was never given any additional press by the newspaper.I repeat that this was told to me by my father years ago.  I buried this for so long that I lost track of when it happened.  I wish that I&apos;d had enough presence of mind to have at least written down the date.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))",

20100624,20100624," Winder, GA", unknown,0,unusual clould path in barrow county georgiaI was working in my garage the night of June 20th and my wife came out after putting my son to bed. It was between 10 and 10:30. I decided to take a break and sit outside on the picnic bench in our front yard. The moon was out and what caught my attention was the huge gap/line in the cloulds. This was not ordinary because because of it&apos;s size. It would have had to be a jet liner flying at about 1200 feet to leave mark of this size. The cloulds that I saw were atleast a mile or two high.The impression that was left had clean edges on the clould and a center line was sort of how a boat motor may leave a line trailing behing.,

Out of the corner of my eye i noticed something moving across the sky and assumed it was a shooting star.  Once I looked at it directly i realized it was an extremely bright blue circle, and much much bigger than a shooting star would have been.  It was so bright that I would almost consider it neon blue.  It didn&apos;t flash or blink any other lights, just the same solid electric blue color.  It moved straight across the sky at a steady pace moving faster than an airplane at the same altitude would&apos;ve been.  It&apos;s hard describe the size since it was up so high, but from that distance it was about the size of a soccer ball. Up close it would obviously be much bigger.  Right when i saw it I knew it was something unusual and started shouting for the other two to look.  By the time they turned around it was gone because the opening in the trees that i saw it through isn&apos;t very big.  It was behind the trees and gone by the time they looked.",

It had different colors, but the most noticeable was green.  If it would have been a firework, I would have judged it to be set off about half a mile away, but I never actually saw any upward trajectory, and there was absolutely no sound to it.  We have had fireworks set off about a mile from our house on holidays, and we can definitely hear them in our rural area.  I stayed outside approximately 5 to 10 minutes, and never heard a sound other than a passenger jet high above.The object was North of me, travelling in a roughly 45 degree angle, appearing to travel from East to West.  It traveled about the same speed as meteors I have seen before, and before it disappeared in the air, it seemed to have a great green flash, with possibly some orange and white.  If I stretched my arms out in front of me, using my hands to determine when it started and appeared to end, I would say the entire event took place within 3 feet, and the final burst or flash appeared about the size of my fist (approx 3 inch diameter), with the core being about the size of a silver dollar.",

The color was white it was so far. the more we got closer (my girlfriend and I were running) the more I could focus on it and I began to see it tilt in the air exactly looking like an oval shape but slanted like 40 degree angle.  So we just stared at it(just in aww trying to decipher the thing) because it was quite signifcant to the plane that was flying near it.  The plane turned around for some reason, I dont know if that had anything to do with the ufo thing.  But it was obvious that it was some type of ufo compared to the plane.  For about one minute and a half it was the same slanted oval shape but it began to disapear, fade away, diminish.  Two seconds later, to the left, about thousands of feet away it reappeared but in a regular horizontal oval shape.  Same color, white with just a touch of shine. It was just there doing nothing just! being white and shiny for about 5 minutes.  It started to fade away,  As it was fading away it turned into a small light blue colored dot just diminishing.  We looked all around us for another shape but nothing.  I&apos;ve never seen anything in the sky like that and I look in the sky quite often seeing falling stars quite often, the stars and astrology type things are amazing.

Went to turn on my cable tv in my bedroom and the cable was out, tried down stairs, it was out too.  I then called my cable company, they ran a circuit test and said everything was fine on their end, so they came to look at my boxes. The cable tech said he had to reprogram the EPROM chips in my boxes with another computer and did, worked fine after that. We talked, there was no lightning or storms the night before that we knew of and I informed all my equipment is on surge protector anyway shouldn&rsquo;t have blown or wiped like that.

It steadily transversed the sky, remaining an unchanging blob of light until it vanished to the west past the top of the hill where Cleveland Avenue runs.

According to the site, there was an iridium flare at 22:50 and another at 23:38, so that would seem to ruled those out as an explanation.  When I got home about 12:40 AM, the ISS was over the Pacific Ocean roughly around Hawaii, so that would seem to rule out that as an explanation.Sunset was at 21:12.

I watched the object move from west to east, I know this as I am familiar with the layout of my parents property. I watched this light for several seconds and determined it was not a plane due to fact that the light was not unidirectional, as would be the case if it were a plane or helicopter.  I called to my nephew who was inside and asked him if he wanted to see something weird. We both observed the light/object as it continued towards the east.  After a few moments he ran inside to tell his mom, my sister, to come out and look at what was in the sky.  I explained that it was weird because there were no flashing port or starboard lights.  The flight speed and altitude was also odd as it seemed to be drifting and did not appear to follow a straight path. I thought that it could possibly be a satellite but due to its brightness and low elevation have considered otherwise.  I doubt that it was a small plane as there was no prop noise.

We were outside watching the space station pass overhead, and while the space station was still visible, we observed the small red glow moving up from the horizon.  It didn&apos;t look like a plane; it looked too big, and it wasn&apos;t blinking, although it did change from red to orange and yellow at inconsistent intervals.  It reminded me of some very slow-moving meteor gradually fizzling out.I suppose it could possibly have been the sunset reflecting off of a plane, although that doesn&apos;t seem likely either; the glow moved toward us across the sky for maybe 40 seconds, before finally seeming to slow, stop, and then quickly fade away and disappear.  My father and I waited for a while to see if we saw anything that looked like a plane continuing along the same path, and didn&apos;t see anything at all.Also, interestingly, I saw some very distant blinking lights that looked like those of planes, traveling right across and perpendicular to the path of that red glow.  How they were traveling was weird; I saw one set of blinking lights move from east to west, I looked away, and when I looked back, there was an identical set of lights moving west to east along what looked like the same path.  This repeated again; I guess I saw at least four planes traveling on almost exactly the same path in opposite directions, or the same plane changing direction three times. The lights didn&apos;t look like those of a helicopter and none of the flying objects made any noise.I&apos;m aware of Wright Patterson Air Force base being about 30 miles away, but it&apos;s northeast of my location unlike those strange lights, and I&apos;ve never been aware of any strange flying objects before.",

If anyone else out there has had a similar experience, I would like to hear/ read about it.  I&apos;m 100% sane, with an IQ in the 130 + range..so I&apos;m NOT some loony-tune.

20100626,20100626," Waukee, IA", light,120seconds,"Bright Zig-Zagging Light over Des Moines, 6/24/10So, I&apos;m standing on my back Deck in the town of Waukee, Iowa [6/24/2010, APRX 9:15 OR 10:15 PM CST] waiting for my dog to pee so I could take her back in and go to bed.Explanation of the time discrepancy: I vaguely remember looking at a clock after this sighting and THOUGHT it said 9:15, but realized the next day that the sun hadn&rsquo;t fully set by 9:15 on that day and I remember it being dark, because despite the ambient light of the city to the east of my house, I could clearly see stars. This leads me to believe that it was really 10:15 and I had misread the clock the night before.Anyway, on 6/24/2010, as I look up, I glance to the west south west I see a very bright white light moving in a easterly direction (toward me, toward Des Moines proper). The brightness is what caught my eye.It was traveling (as near as I can figure) in a straight line toward the east, perhaps east, north east. No green/red aircraft lights as one would see on an airliner. In fact I saw a jet liner flying to the east far above this object.I am not good at estimating altitude but it, and as such I have a hard time telling you how big this thing was. But the jet liner moving east above this thing looked to be more than twice as high, that&apos;s the impression I got anyway.So I figured, it&apos;s an airplane with its landing lights on and the landing lights are washing out the red/green strobes so that I can&apos;t see them. But as the thing keeps moving east, the light doesn&apos;t die out at all.If it were an aircraft landing light, it would be directional. You might see it very brightly as the aircraft was moving toward you but it would become more difficult to see as the plane moved over and started moving away from you.The thing moved over where I was standing, perhaps to the south of my position a little bit but clearly over the city of Des Moines, then it kept moving at the same rate of speed BUT it began moving (or at least the light did) in a slightly, nearly unnoticeable zig-zag manner.Mind you, I can see nothing but the bright white light. I see no craft/structure, no wings, nothing but the light. And the light continues off in an easterly direction until I lose sight of it behind the roofline of the other houses behind mine. It moved in a straight tack and for about 15 seconds, in a slightly zig-zag manner but it stayed at a steady speed. It wasn&apos;t very fast at all. The jet liner above it overtook it easily.It made no noise that I could hear but it might have been too far away and it appeared to be illuminated all the way around. In other words, the light stayed bright, no matter the angle at which I viewed the thing.I doubt it was a helicopter because if it was it seemed too high (although I have a hard time judging altitude) and even if it was a helicopter, what&apos;s with the 360 degree illumination effect? Even those super bright spotlights on helicopters are directional.I tried taking a picture of it, but my crappy cell phone camera is all I had close and all you could see was a blurry white spot on a black background, it didn&apos;t tell the story at all and I deleted it out of frustration (sorry). By the time I could have gone in and gotten my good camera, come out, set it up and get the shot, the thing would have been gone.So, whatever this thing was, I remember thinking that the airliner flying above might not have been able to see it because of the illumination from the city below, but who knows? If the airliner did see it, he didn&apos;t alter his course or anything so it must not have concerned him. But the thing was very bright, in comparison to the stars (and the night was very clear), it was easily noticeable at first glance.All told, it crossed the sky (from rooftops to the west to roofline in the east) in about 90-120 seconds. I remember distinctly thinking that whatever I was seeing wasn&apos;t normal so I made a point to watch it intently (another reason I didn&apos;t go for the good camera). It was right after I made this decision that it started to zig-zag (again, ever-so slightly) and I remember wondering just what exactly I was seeing. The zig-zag was just enough to be noticeable but slight enough to make me wonder if I was perhaps seeing things correctly.Now I am rationalizing and explaining it away as any number of plausible explanations. But the fact that it was #1 so bright #2 had no red/greens #3 moving relatively slowly compared with the air traffic above it #4 IT ZIG ZAGGED. I&apos;m baffled and my logic tells me that it could not have zig-zagged, but I KNOW I saw the thing zig-zag!  So tell me I&apos;m not crazy! Explain this thing to me. I know what it was not...It wasn&apos;t a balloon (too fast, steady speed, night, over a metro area close to an airport). I know it wasn&apos;t the space station, a meteor or a satellite...a jet liner flew OVER it. The jet-liner above it was further to the south than the light, but from my angle I watched as the airplane disappeared briefly behind this light then reappeared as the plane outpaced the light.I seriously doubt that it was a helicopter. I was a flight medic for some years and I know rotor-craft, especially the commonly seen rotor-craft in this area. The flight path didn&apos;t make sense (for a medical helicopter anyway). It came from out of town and bypassed all hospitals and went back out of town to the east.Maybe it was military, but our Air Guard base is south of where this thing flew...it wasn&apos;t on approach to DSM International, it was WAY too far north, its course did not change and it didn&rsquo;t appear to change altitude at all (again difficult to judge &amp; be certain). It certainly didn&apos;t just take off from DSM either.  I suppose it could have been like a private plane/jet or even a military jet, but I could hear NOTHING and what&apos;s with the light?  Let alone the ZIG ZAGGING!!!???  Once the light disappeared over the roofline to the east and I could no longer see it, I brought the dog back in and went to bed.  I had completely forgotten about seeing the light until the following evening and I shared this report on an online forum where someone suggested that I report the event to you.",

We&apos;re right where the Indiana and Michigan state lines meet, and also where St. Joseph and Elkhart counties in Indiana meet.  There were no clouds in the sky and it was about an hour after sunset.We were outside doing fireworks for the kids when my daughter said &quot;look, a UFO!&quot;  I thought she had seen a plane but when I looked, there was a very bright red light in the east, less than 10 degrees above the horizon and I would guess about 5 miles from us.The light moved from east to west, right toward us.  It only took about 20 seconds to get to us, and it grew in size very quickly.  At its closest, I&apos;d say it was the size of a dime held at arm&apos;s length.  There were no flashing lights but it was giving off a VERY bright red light from what appeared to be inside.  It was the most incredible red, like a massive Christmas tree light but it didn&apos;t really flicker.  It wasn&apos;t just a glowing light because we could see there was some structure to it by the way the light didn&apos;t come from beneath it.  There was no sound at all, even at it&apos;s closest, which I&apos;d guess to be less than 1/2 mile away.After it got to its closest point to us, it changed direction and turned 90 degrees to its right and headed north over southern Cass county, Michigan.  An airplane would have had to make an arc to change direction.  This thing simply stopped moving west and started heading north.  We clearly knew it wasn&apos;t a meteor, which would have been much faster and kept going straight.  I went into the house to get the video camera but I couldn&apos;t find the buttons to start it up.  Within 20 seconds after it turned, the object was out of sight.  As it flew away, it appeared to rise a little in the sky and the light rapidly grew faint as it flew away.

20100626,20100626," Bowling Green, KY", disk,five minutes,"Flying disk-shaped object seen traveling in a straight lineI&apos;m sorry but my computer would not let me do the copy and paste.  I live a short distance from where this incident took place.  This is my report, and I am an expert U.S. Government typist.  On Friday,  June 25, 2010, at around 3:00 PM, I was in town doing some shopping at our local Kroger store on the Scottsville Road.  The day was clear, hot, and humid.  When I came out of the Kroger store I saw a man in the parking lot looking up into the sky, so I decided to have a look for myself.  We both saw to our amazement what looked like a flying disk or saucer-type object traveling straight across the sky.  At first I dismissed it as a balloon, but the longer I watched it I began to wonder exactly what it was that we were seeing.  The object was large, and looked to be twice the size of an automobile.  There were no other around either.  It was about a mile away as close as I could tell.  The object was disk-shaped and was a very shiny silver color.  There looked t! o be indentations or lights around the edges of the object as well.  The main reasons I began to truly wonder if it was a balloon was these.  The object traveled in a very straight path line where as a balloon would wobble up and down and not fly in a straight formation.  As the silver object flew it tilted from one side to the other about a mile apart each time as if showing off.  First it tilted and flew sideways with its top showing, and then it would tilt again and fly sideways with the bottom showing.  The object repeatedly  did this over and over again the whole fives minutes I watched it.  If it was a craft it may have been going out of control.  There were no streamers of markings on, or attached, to the object like a balloon would have either.  It continued flying along at the same altitude.  I put my groceries inside my car, and then looked back up and the object was gone.  I think it may have went behind some cloud cover or fell somewhere.  This may be a coincide! nce, but shortly after as I was traveling home on the Scottsvi! lle Road their was a traffic jam or something holding up the traffic.  Finally we came upon a large semi truck that was stopped dead in the road.  To make it seem weird there was nothing visible wrong with the truck, and I could not a see any truck drivers either.  No other vehicles were damaged either.  There were close to seven police cars that just simply had this truck surrounded, and the roadway cordoned off.  Amazingly, the truck was in a direct path as to where the mysterius disk-shaped object would have traveled over.  Did he see it and stop?  Did something crash?  I don&apos;t know.  Did anyone else see this object besides us?  Did the object stop the engine of the truck?  I wonder now.  Anyway, that&apos;s my report.  I am a Christian, and this sighting is true and accurate to the best of my ability.  If anyone else saw this object I would love to know about it.",

After it traveled from left to right it hesitated, and then traveled sharply back to the left for a short time, and then changed direction again to proceed to travel to the right out of the scope of the skylight. I ran outside to follow it further but it was no longer there.  I feel that it could not have been a space station or a satellite sighting because it moved too fast and because of the way it changed direction. When I first saw it through my skylight I thought it was a shooting star or a comet.   If I was to try to debunk this account I would take into consideration that we live within 120 miles + or - of the Norfolk air force navy base.  I would first consider this either a shooting star based on it&rsquo;s appearance or a test rocket from said base, however it rapidly changed direction and speed.  This was no rocket in low altitude and it was no space station.  I understand that rockets and earthly crafts travel fast, however this damn thing was booking.   I first thought it to be a shooting star.To be perfectly frank I was offended by the rudeness of the hotline phone proctor who asked me to summarize this in ten seconds and after five would interrupt because he needed to go to a social engagement.

At about 20:30 on January 4, 2000, (est.), my son was in the vicinity of Jomax Rd. and 62nd St. looking toward the south at the lights of Phoenix in the distance.  The day had been overcast with some rain, which had stopped in the evening.  A light at the extreme right side of his field of view caused him to look in that direction, west.  He witnessed a vivid green circular object descending at about a 30 degree angle, the object was the size of a dime at arms length.  At a height of about 200 feet above the ground the object stopped and a second identical object then appeared as if out of the first and proceeded on the same path and speed until it was about 12 diameters from the first, then it too stopped.  A third identical object immediately appeared, traveled the same distance, stopped, and a fourth identical object repeated the process until it reached the 12 diameter distance.

After the ISS reached its zenith and was getting lower in the north-east sky I observed an orange reddish light in the sky to the north.  It was hovering near the constellations of Cepheus and Cassiopea.  It was nearly motionless though it appeared to move vertically very slowly during the two minutes it was visible.The orange reddish light had a flickering appearance and was slightly larger than the apparent size of the ISS and was much less bright than the ISS.  My best guess on apparent magnitude would be roughly 1.0.After two minutes the light disappeared from sight.  The light made no sound and appeared to be roughly 2-4 miles away.  It had no navigation lights, anti-collision strobes or landing lights like the normal air traffic in this area.  The local visibility was excellent with no clouds in the sky and no haze.The closest approximation to what I saw would be sky lanterns made from dry cleaning bags but this looked different.",

It was about 9:45pm.  I was driving and we were all admiring the full moon.I noticed a red light in the sky at a 5 o&rsquo;clock position from the moon.  I thought it might be a planet and asked them that.  It was about the size of the North Star when it first appears in the night sky.  My daughter said if it was a planet it would be Mars because of the color.  We were all looking at it and noticed that it was not steady in the sky and was pulsing slightly.  It was not moving in big movements but steady, like when a helicopter is trying to stay stationary.As we were watching it trying to figure out what it was its glow changed in size and its color was a vibrant red glow.  It increased over 20% of its original size and continued pulsing.  I asked my sister to get her camera out of her purse so we could get some video of it.  As she was getting it out of her purse it decreased in size and went to how it was before.I turned off the road I was on and traveled down a residential road with my hand out the driver&rsquo;s side window taking video of the object.  I had to stop when a car came up behind me.  I turned towards home and that is when my daughter said that it is gone.   When we pulled into our driveway I went to search the sky to see if there were any planes or anything, but nothing was there.  Just the full moon.I don&rsquo;t know what we saw, but I know it is nothing I have ever viewed in the night sky before.From the time I first noticed it to the time it vanished was close to 5 minutes.I will get the video from my sister as soon as she returns from vacation and send it in.",

He wanted me to go outside and see if I could observe the lights he was looking at north of his location and close to the horizon.  I immediately went outside and looked in the direction he had indicated and was able to see a faint green light just above the horizon northeast of me which appeared to be somewhere near the direction of Ft Ord.  I told him to grab his digital video camera and film what we were seeing.  I immediately went inside and grabbed some binoculars and was able to distinguish a brilliant green light moving erratically near the horizon.  The light would move in an approximately east to west direction at a slow pace, randomly stop and hover then move again in spurts and change direction very rapidly.  It took about 5 minutes for me to locate the other light, which was blue in color, and I was able to observe both lights moving independent of each other.  The blue light would periodically disappear and then come back into view.  Generally it would appear as if the blue light would take off vertically and disappear behind the cloud cover.  At other times my view of the blue light was obscured by intervening trees. The blue light eventually disappeared from my view even though my brother did indicate that he could still see it.  At no time did I observe any navigational lights that would indicate that either of these objects were some kind of aircraft.

20100628,20100628," Utica, NY", light,about one minute,"Fast  moving light seen from passenger jet over upstate NYObject seen during United Airlines flight 200 from Chicago to Albany, NY.  I was a passenger on the left side of the cabin, with a view to the north out my window.  Lights in the cabin were dimmed aside from a few reading lights and television screens for the inflight entertainment. It was probably sometime between 11:20 and 11:50 pm.  The weather was mostly clear, with the stars and moon easily visible and a very small amount of light left from sunset at the northwestern horizon.  Our flight was beginning to make its initial descent to the Albany airport, but still very high- as the cruising altitude of the flight was announced to be 39,000 feet.   As a former resident of Upstate NY, I could determine when we flew over Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse.  When we began approaching what I believe to be Utica, and possibly Rome to the North, I noticed a bright point of warm white light which at a quick glance would apprear to be a bright star or planet (no blinking ! to indicate it was a commercial aircraft,) to the north.  It was moving significantly faster than our aircraft to the ENE direction.   As it was to my eyes, simply a small, steady light, there was no way to determine how large or far away it was from our jet.  It is entirely possible that it was a high-altitude aircraft, or satellite, but it seemed to be moving much more quickly than satellites I&apos;ve observed from a stationary position on the ground. I was only able to observe it for a minute or so, as it flew somewhat parrallel and higher than aircraft, then quickly away.  There was no change of speed during the sighting.  The light appeared to be flying in a straight line, although I may have seen it swerve slightly a couple of times- possibly due to air movement between myself and the object, or the movement of our aircraft.  No other passengers that I was near seemed to notice anything, and as I was traveling alone, I did not alert anyone around me to what I saw.I consider myself a skeptic, and I am making this report simply because it was something that I could not easily identify.  It did not look the same as other commercial or military aircraft I&apos;ve seen from an airplane, and it was thousands of feet higher than necessary for a plane to use landing lights.",

It would have had to move at a tremendous speed to disappear in that time.

We were staring up at the stars and discussing this and that as far as astrology and things of that nature when I noticed a ball of light moving across the sky.  I immediately told my Mom and pointed it out for her to locate as it continued across the night sky.  It looked very similar to a star but as it got to be directly over head it went from a star like glow to a much more intense brightness that I could almost characterize as gleaming.  As the object moved off in a North Western direction it&apos;s intesity lessened and then in a blink of an eye it just disappeared.  There were no beacon lights as if on airplanes blinking or otherwise.  There is no way this could have been mistaken for a regular commercial airliner.  I know this because we sat out for another hour after this sighting identifying actual airplanes and making sure they loo! ked nothing like what we had just witnessed. (10 Minutes before this sighting I witnessed something very similar and also pointed this out to my Mom but it was much dimmer and less noticable in the night sky.)",

I saw something reflecting in the sky that caught my attention and pointed it out to my husband.  It was traveling from East to West, was silver, and cigar or oval shape.  We kept discussing what we thought it could be, since we were intrigued by this &quot;thing&quot; in the sky.  There was no contrail from a jet/airplane and it seemed to be hovering at times, so we ruled out that option.  My husband then thought it could be the Space Station reflecting off the sun, so we called a friend who then went to the Space Station Tracking site.  He called us back and said the Space Station was not in our area at that particular time and the Space Station only travels from West to East.  During this time, my husband pulled over the truck so I could look through our binoculars, but I could never find the object when I used them.  My husband tried! as well, but our binoculars must not be that magnified.  We then continued on our way home, while following this object in the sky.  It seemed to move very slowly and would stop and hover.  We could still see the object slowly moving when we turned and pulled over on Cty. Rd. O towards home.  While traveling on Cty. Rd.

I began to watch it as it traveled across the sky very slowly.  It was low for a jet or commercial plane, but still much higher than any blimp you would normally see.  I began to think maybe it was a weather balloon of some type, but eventually decided that since it was traveling on such a direct path that it must be some sort of vehicle with an engine.  I was first surprised by the fact of a blimp so high in the air at first, but what really surprised me was what happened after it had traveled halfway across the sky.  It was traveling at the same speed, never stopped or slowed or sped up, yet when it had traveled roughly halfway across the horizon it spat out a huge chunk of white &quot;smoke&quot;.  Then about 3-5 seconds later it spit out another hunk of what I thought was smoke.  Now there were 2 dashes ! of smoke across the sky coming from what I thought was a blimp.  My second witness also witnessed these puffs of smoke.  However, seconds after these two puffs were spat out, it began to emit a CONSTANT trail of this smoke like substance, just like your typical Chemtrail (or Contrail, I suppose).  After traveling at the same speed completely across the horizon, this Blimp (which looked like a cigar covered in Aluminum foil) just SUDDENLY, out of nowhere without changing a thing in trajectory, speed, or altitude, began to omit a chemtrail. It literally looked like a giant crop-dusting blimp, miles in the air.  The thought of it made us feel extremely eerie and upset for the remainder of the day.",

I said yes, and gave her my description, and told ! her i was freaked , she said an officer at the crystal flash seen them and pretty much gave her the exact report.  We went back to fishing needless to say our other stepbrother really didn&apos;t believe us.  My other witness said that when he seen it first it was like a line, or possibly a triangle, and when it spread apart he said it made a geometric pattern or design that he could connect with lines.  Then I got a call at 12:15 from the police.  She told me she called the airport and the military, nothing is going on but there was one plane somewhere in the area.  And the officer that seen it wanted to file a report with the military and the initernational airport police,  And wanted to use my name. I gave themm permission.

20100630,20100630," Hat Creek, CA", diamond,10-15 seconds,"Two sightings of the same object  within 22 hours of each other in Northern CaliforniaThis is two events within 21 hours of each other. At approximately 12:40am Sunday the 27th my friend and I went outside to talk and we were seated facing west. I was looking up to the southwest a bit when a bright flash of light with a diamond shape object in the middle just appeared. It came in really fast through what I call a portal, with a bright flash of light. AS it entered it stopped in the sky almost as fast as it came in and floated slowly from my left to right, a south to north movement as I could tell.After the initial bright flash of light as it broke into our atmosphere and as it began it&apos;s glide/descent, the light quickly faded but not light instant on instant off. It just dimmed but as the celestial craft dimmed it also began to cloak or transform into a small light behind the foliage of the tree. I could see the small light just either go away from me or disappear altogether. My friend witnessed some of the event but not all; from the dimming glide to the small light. This event took about 10 seconds or so.I was in total awe but the initial reaction I felt was that stir in your stomach and that tinge of fear that comes from seeing something so celestial you just know it is not of this world. I thought. &quot;Oh my God&quot; and I exclaimed &apos;what is that!?!&quot; which was then when my friend pulled the focus. I could see the object/craft so clearly as it entered our airspace, and I say that because I have seen many things concerning outer/inner world phenomenon like fireballs screaming across the sky, meteors striking our atmosphere so hard I could see the outer layer of earth&apos;s atmosphere and even sightings of UFO&apos;s floating in the sky. This brightness entered our earth and came to a halt as if it was the easiest thing an aircraft could do.The second sighting came at 9:35pm the very same day, Sunday 27th and lasted more or less about a minute. Me and my friends jokingly said, &quot;let&apos;s sit outside and lets see em again.&quot; We looked in the same position and my friend says,&quot;here they come&quot; but in a joking manner because he saw a bright star coming at us. He said it again, and then again and I realized the pitch in his voice changed and this object was moving straight towards us.It was moving, no gliding across the sky from west(southwest) to east(northeast). It was in perfect view and I could see the diamond shape craft/celestial with a light that was so bright and . . . pure. I mean, I can&apos;t really describe it because I have NEVER seen such beautiful white bright light like this celestial emanated. It was smooth as glass and it was so bright and white there was this hue of blue in the center of the diamond shape... incredible beauty of light! It was so . . . pure  It was too early for a star to be this bright. Even Venus was dim because there was light in the sky still. This was as pure brightness and a color of light I had never seen.  As it moved across the sky it was unworldly in its movement. By that I mean unlike any aircraft we know today. Not like a plane or even a high flying jet aircraft. They ALL move with a worldly rhythm but this moved so effortlessly across the sky at a pace that is not of this planet.  It glided without movement or turbulence of any kind and the brightness of the light NEVER wavered.  It stayed beautiful and bright throughout the course of it&apos;s flight until it went out of our vision.  It moved from west to east and it was SILENT and PERFECT! NO SOUND came from this celestial at all.  I ran from one yard to another yard to follow the flight path and I tried videotaping it but I could not capture it.  I&apos;ll look again but it was dark on camera.I know something big is happening. It just falls into place with what I know is occurring with the planets.  My psychic ability tells me that we are in a transformation for all the human race but now I realize this is on a much larger scale than even I had foreseen.I am still in awe and I know this is not just another sighting, I just know that. Seeing something move across the sky is one thing; watching a diamond craft/celestial enter our airspace, and come to a halt like it did with such ease is another.  Maybe it didn&apos;t know, or care, that I saw it enter but it wanted us/me to see it later that evening.  It was clear and not fuzzy, it was close and not far away although I cannot tell the size from its flight.  It looked HUGE when it entered the portal early morning but much smaller when we saw it later.  I/we saw it clearly and it was, for lack of better words, beautifully perfect.",
20100630,20100630," Lafayette, CO", triangle,7-10 Seconds,"I completed a report on your site over a year ago and it was very brief and not as descriptive as I should have been in my initial report.  But since the time of my sighting, I have left out so many other significant factors to that night/morning that I just felt compelled to write to you again and explain the whole event, as there is so much more to mention.I have talked about my experience with several people over the past several months and have been made fun of countless times by friends and co-workers, but I still feel the need to explain the whole story to get it off my chest.On 1/2/09, I received a call from a friend&rsquo;s son, who begged me to come up to Lafayette CO, to watch some meteor showers after I got off of work.  It was on a Friday and I was very tired and did not want to drive up there and hang out that particular night.  But the boy who was 13 or 14 at the time kept insisting that I come up and stay the night.  In fact, her 2 other children got on the phone and begged to see me as well and after I spoke with them, I felt compelled to drive up there.  So I packed a bag and headed north from my house in Denver.I arrived at about 8:00pm-8: 30pm and it was cold and I was dragging butt after a long week.  The kids immediately asked me to run to 7-11 to buy firewood for the outdoor fireplace as it was going to be even colder later that night and into the early morning hours.  So I bought 3 or 4 bundles of wood for our night.  Upon our return from 7-11, we hung out for a while and planned our night and agreed that we (my friend and I) would get up around 3:00am-3: 30am to start making hot cocoa and coffee for the 4:00 am showers.  But at around 11:00pm-11: 30pm, the kids were very hyper and were not ready for bed by any means.  They asked me if we could burn one of the bundles of wood and sky watch for a while before heading to bed.  I hesitantly said yes but knew that I was fading fast and didn&rsquo;t have much energy from a long week at work.  At any rate, I didn&rsquo;t want to disappoint them, so we headed outside.Once we got the fire going and brought out blankets and snacks, my friend&rsquo;s daughter (7 yr. old) climbed on lap to stay warm.  The 2 boys, I believe were 13 and 11 were running around singing loud and throwing things in the yard.  I was getting annoyed because I didn&rsquo;t have the energy they had and I really wanted to just chill out and relax in quite and peace.  The little girl fell asleep in my lap almost immediately as she was bundled up well and was pretty warm.  About 10-15 minutes after she fell asleep, I saw a gray animal or &quot;something&quot; running in a very weird manner along the side of the fence.  Whatever it was, it used a hand as well as its legs to run and hop at the same time.  At first glance I thought it was a wild animal and as soon as I had that thought, I literally threw the girl off of me and yelled, &quot;What ((deleted)) was that?&quot;   This thing moved very fast along the fence and was gone in no time at all.  My friend had her back to the &quot;thing&quot; and the boys were running wild and didn&rsquo;t see anything.  I was so freaked out; I didn&rsquo;t want to stay out there anymore.  I told them what I saw and they kept asking questions and so on.  Finally, I said that I was going to go inside and sleep for a while because I was getting up at 3:00am-3: 30am to make the snacks and then to watch the showers.  Plus, we needed to save some of the wood I bought.  So the boys said that they were staying downstairs to watch movies with the intention of staying awake all night.  My friend, her daughter and I went upstairs to her bedroom and we all were going to sleep together in the same bed.  After we jumped into bed, I was on one end, my friend in the middle, and her daughter was at the other end snuggled up with her mom.  I fell asleep immediately.After sleeping for a while, I woke up freezing like I have never felt before. (I have lived in Colorado my whole life and never wore coats in the winter and would only wear jackets because I am always hot).  So I pulled the blankets up to cover myself up more.  As soon as I did this, I was immediately burning up.  I threw the blankets off of me, and I was freezing again.  By this time, I woke up because my face touched my arm, which was like an ice-cube.  My eyes opened and I rolled over to see a purple light hovering below the ceiling.  I tried to focus my eyes to understand what I was seeing, but I could never really make out what it was.  It just changed shapes and was hovering about 3 or 4 inches from the ceiling, closer to my side of the bed.  I watched the thing for about 10-15 minutes before I decided to get dressed and start making the coffee and snacks.1/3/09  At about 3:40am, I woke up my friend and told her what happened in the bedroom and she decided to get up too.  I also told her that the boys were downstairs sleeping in the livingroom with the TV still on.  I told her to look for her video camera with the infrared feature so that we can have it for the showers.  Then it occurred to me that she may want a smoke before the kids got up (they didn&rsquo;t know she smoked) so we decided to smoke first before getting any cameras together.  Besides, I&rsquo;m not good with any kind of camera with the exception of a cell phone camera so this was going to be all on her to set that part up.This is the part that I originally reported to this site, but I left out some stuff so I need to re-tell the story.A couple of minutes before 4:00am, we went outside to smoke.  We were out there for a short while when I saw what looked like a flock of geese flying towards us.  I pointed in the direction of where I was looking and yelled, &quot;Look!&quot;   As soon as I said that, I then realized that this was not a flock of geese at all.  It was a triangular shaped object that was gray on the outside of the perimeter and on the bottom, but shiny black finish on the rest of it.  As soon as I told her to look, the thing changed direction a little and aimed its path towards us.  It was directly over us about 300-500 ft in the air and made no sound and was moving very slow.  I initially said that it was going 30-40mph, but it was going slower than that.  My friend stood there with her mouth open and totally freaked out and I started checking in with her because I thought she was going to start screaming or something.  By this time, we could see directly underneath this thing and again, it was gray, with a light at each point of the triangle, with a round &quot;portal&quot; in the center and some weird designs on the bottom.  It didn&rsquo;t make a sound at all. It started moving in between her house and her neighbor&rsquo;s house and I started to chase it.  When I started running after it, I knocked over the chairs on the patio and bumped the table really loud, when all of the sudden, it disappeared right in front of us.  The lights weren&rsquo;t on, but something inside was illuminating the lights from within to let us know they were lights.  And it looked as though it was using our street lamps and porch lights to guide itself.  I know I said that we watched this thing for 7 seconds in the first report, but there was no way it could have been that short because of the detail we were able to extract from it.  That was one of the things that always bothered me about it my first report. It was more like 20-30 seconds.After it disappeared, we went in and woke up the boys first.  My friend said, &quot;That was the most amazing UFO I have ever seen.&quot;  We started telling the kids to get up in case it came back, and because it was time for the showers.  So after we got settled in our spots, the showers came down immediately.  During the showers, we saw more UFO activity with lights flying low all over the place and doing crazy maneuvers and indescribable movements. We would keep talking about it for the next 2 hours.So at about 6:00am-6: 30am, the wood was almost gone, the winds were picking up and some light snow started to fall. I told everyone that I was going back to bed because I really didn&rsquo;t sleep much and I was freezing again.  So I went upstairs to lay down in my friend&rsquo;s bed again alone.  The purple light was gone this time.  At about 7:00am, my friend came in to crash too for a while.  However, at 8:30am, I got up to go to the bathroom. In the bathroom, there are lots of windows to look at onto the front yard.  When I glanced out of one of the windows, I saw a light layer of snow (about an inch high) covering the ground, with a perfect circle partly on the grass, sidewalk, and street in her front yard.  There were no tire tracks, footprints of any kind or anything else near the circle or any other place out front. It was totally untouched by humans or animals. I woke my friend up again and to show her what was out front.  She looked out the window and asked me, &quot;What the hell happened last night?&quot;I know this was a long story, but I had to go back and correct some things.  I just couldn&rsquo;t keep all of this information out of this crazy experience.  I swear that I am not making this up and have witnesses to substantiate this weird night/morning.  My friend has agreed to talk to anyone about her piece of the story too.  However, we do have to keep the kids out of it for obvious reasons.  However, my friend&rsquo;s children and I have experienced other UFO&rsquo;s that same year, at that same house.  And there is more to tell, believe me!  But that was the most amazing UFO at that house because it was so huge.  But we do have more stories about some other cool sighting too of a smaller triangle flying 20ft above our heads 3x&rsquo;s in the same night.  But that&rsquo;s another story for another time.  Besides, I don&rsquo;t remember the date of that one.",
20100630,20100630," Salina, KS", light,1 hour,"Flashing red light in south western sky emits light orbs and is seemingly pursued by a fighter jet.It was about 11:30pm central and I was outside in my backyard on the phone with a friend, looking at the stars as I frequently do when I&apos;m outside, and I notice a flashing red light sitting in the sky to the south west.  I continue on with my conversation just watching it when it starts to move east still flashing. I ask my friend who lives about 7 blocks north of me to go outside and look, he sees it as well but dismissed it since he has work in the morning. So we get off the phone and I continue watching it, it then changes direction from moving east to moving west immediately without slowing and appeared to continue at the same speed it had been going, which is when I decided to go inside and tell my Father to come out and look.  So we go to our back yard and continue observing it, it then starts moving from west to north.  We watch it for a little while, every now and then the light would just stop then resume 10-20 seconds later, not in sequence, just at random times this would happen.  It continued doing strange maneuvers such as ascending and descending quickly, changing direction without slowing, sometimes stopping altogether, and changing speed sporadically from very slow to fast. It stays in about the same general area, to the south and to the west turning, moving back and forth up and down over that area.  We were already amazed by how it was changing direction immediately with no change of speed, it didn&apos;t slow down it simply started moving the opposite direction in an instant, and did that numerous times.  After a while of this it is in the same area, still south west but slightly more west, and it stops as it had done a few times before.  This next part happens over the span of 3-4 seconds:  When it stops the light goes off, also as it had done numerous times beforehand, and suddenly emits a very very bright white orb of light about twice the size of the initial flashing red object we had been observing, and I&apos;m talking ! really bright, this white orb seemingly splits into 2 orbs of ! light, o ne descending and one ascending which both dim and go out very quickly. As I said that happened over the course of 3-4 seconds, and was quite extraordinary. The object then resumes moving, and is heading west to a point where the tree line behind our house was blocking our view so we couldn&apos;t see it. Over the course of the next 10 or more minutes we would see it over the tree line a few times, moving south, sometimes north, and still flashing. At a few points in time over the course of the whole observation when the blinking would cease, rather than us not seeing it which had happened a few times, it would appear as just a solid red light moving, then continue flashing. The flashes were slow the whole time they were happening, not in perfect sequence but each was about one second apart, sometimes slightly faster sometimes slightly slower. So at this point we&apos;re only seeing it every now and then over the treeline, until it moves farther west to the point where we don&apos;t see it! at all for about 5 minutes. It had never made any noise. There are many fighter jets at our airport currently, they fly over many times a day, they are much louder and fly much lower than the commercial planes that fly over town do, about the same altitude the propeller planes fly at. One takes off from the airport which is about 1 1/2 miles west of our house, we saw it ascend from the area of the airport, it was flying low, looped around east over the very edge of town not far from our house with all of it&apos;s lights on, and as it turned south west the engines got much louder, and took off fast in the direction of the object we had been observing until it too moved far enough that the tree line prevented us from seeing it. We continued watching  for a while and neither returned. It was right about 12:25am when we decided to go in since it was late and the event appeared to be over. I&apos;ve returned outside numerous times over the course of the night and it has not returned, an! d obviously decided it was worth reporting, in hopes somebody ! else may have seen this. It has inspired me to buy a high definition video camera, it would have been amazing to have recorded.((NUFORC Note:  Celestial body?  PD))",

I&apos;m sure it was probably just an ordinary airplane, but this one seemed odd, because there was no pulsation or variation of the light at all.  No blinking, no change what-so-ever.  It looked similar to the way a satellite looks(only considerably bigger and a different color), but appeared to all of us to be much lower in the sky than a satellite.  It seemed to be at about the same altitude that a small aircraft would fly.  I&apos;d estimate maybe only 4 or 5 thousand feet.  It was a very deep unchanging orange/reddish color.  It was moving the opposite direction as we were (west to east), and was visible for about 5 minutes before it just kind of blinked out.  It wasn&apos;t moving particularly fast.  I&apos;d say maybe in the 100-125mph range?  Like I said, it was probably just a plane I suppose, but I live near MSP and watch planes come in and out all the time, and this was weird looking because it was just static/unchanging.

Lights where hovering ahead of the craft and ahead of a strange looking cloud, apparently monitor things up ahead.  The lights where circling around  75-100 feet from the ground going southeast in the countryside between the towns of Sikeston and Blodget Missouri.  Four rotating lights going clockwise made a complete revolution, then would come together in the center joining together making a fifth light. Afterwards, the rotating lights moved outwards to make another rotation pattern. This continued patterned  lasted for about 30 minutes. The lights where flat and symmetrical, about 10-15 feet across with no visible source of reference and silenced.   Some times, the rotating pattern got larger and come across our street, and other times it got smaller.  The sky was clea! r from were the lights were dancing around, but behind the lights there were some thin cumulus clouds.  The lights moved with the clouds at a very slow pace, perhaps 1 mph.  The sky was visible through the breaking clouds and at times the stars and the partly full moon was visible.   When the clouds rolled across the highline electrical grid it caused some disturbance and made an object temporary visible though the breaking clouds.  The object that was hiding above (or inside) the clouds was temporary visible until it passed the electrical power lines.    This object was black but it appeared like it was shorting out because there where green flairs sparking around it. The size and shape was not visible on account that it was partially cloned and hidden by the cloud.",

This time I saw a bright white flash that came from the high school I am attending.  I noticed the strange object was giving off a bright light and would become dull once more and repeat this cycle.  As minutes stretched by it faded from the sky, as if leaving earth.  The shape is oval and the object fades from a musty brown back to a blinding white. I am a young person and not very skeptical.

The objects were in no particular formation, they were randomly staggered to describe it best.  From my view they approached from the north making their way into my view from my building which blocked that part of the sky.  They were approaching my next visual obstacle, a tree, when one light seemed to disappear in the distance as if it went straight into the sky or due west away from me.

It&apos;s really bright and teardrop shaped.  This started June 10th and had accured every night since.  Only one night did I see it move.  Thats when I decided to report this.  That really spooked me a bit. 6-29-10 was the only time I saw it move.  I jumped in my car and followed it.  When it was flying I heard no sounds at all and the light seemed to change to a strobe looking light in the middle and appeared to have solid lights around the perimeter of the craft.  It appeared to stop at  times and change direction fast. I followed it down to main street in Norristown where it appeared to hover for a while.

Object was moving very fast in a straight line with no deviation (direction of downtown Kansas City, MO), however it seemed to move faster than most satellites I have seen. No sound heard. Light then slowly turned red for 1-2 seconds (slower than a strobe light/anti-collision light on aircraft) and then back to blueish-white. This occured 3 more times before object became too difficult to see (distance and city lights in the distance). Light appeared to dissapear twice, as if passing through or above clouds (skies were clear from what I could tell, may have been very thin, high cloud! s in the area). Possible sources could have been satellite (was very similar in color, size, and altitude but this was traveling faster and I have never seen them emit red light), meteor (no tail, trailing light, or change in intensity), or military aircraft/fighter (have seen these before with a single, fast blinking red light, but to the best of my knowledge these do not emit a dim blueish-white light when moving away from viewing position).

All this took place between 9 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. local time.Around 9 p.m. I went out for my evening star gazing and watching the satellites go by.At the start I saw what I can only describe as flashes of light in the sky.  The flashes of light looked like a flash from a camera.  Then I observed what I thought was a satellite until the satellite went from moving from a northern to southern direction to veering to a southwesterly direction.  Satellites do not normally change their directional course as they cannot.  They always move in the same direction without veering off course.  This satellite seemed to be dark gray in color and was silhouetted against the night sky. I saw this with my naked eye.Then I saw the similar flashes of light again.  After this I saw another &quot;satellite&quot; that was moving across the sky.  This time the satellite stopped, then let off a &quot;pouf&quot; of periwinkle to white color, then moved again.  I observed through binocs what seemed to be a lighted object with periwinkle and white lights.  This satellite then moved and faded away.  Approximately a half hour later this same satellite reappeared towards the southwest portion of the sky and repeated the same set of movements and colorations before fading out.I saw the flashes of light each time before the bluish white satellite reappeared.This was also seen by another witness who was with me.

Me my husband and my son went running downstairs and my husband went to the backdoor (running) to investigate because my daughter is very meek and quiet and never screams.  The next thing I know my husband is yelling &quot;run&quot; &quot;its gonna hit us&quot; and he started praying to God that we lived and if not take us to Heaven.  We ran straight out the door as fast as our legs would go.  Myself and my son never heard or saw anything we were just running for dear life.  My husband told us to stop behind the trees because he thought at any moment it would hit and we wouldnt get much father and we live in the country so its all mostly open space.  When nothing happened he told us to keep running as I horrifyingly saw him turn back toward the house.  We kept going as we went trying to call our dogs that had escaped with us.  My husband returned in his truck to state the object simply vanished he had no idea where it went but it never hit our house or flew over us.  So we continued the search for our dogs however one was struck by a car and killed.  Later when I spoke with my husband and daughter I was informed it had 2 bright lights and was up in the sky they could see the back neighbors house below it and it made no sound and teetered a little back and forth but the lights were always horizontal to eachother.  This object made no sound what so ever and my husband said he saw the silhouette and it was as big as our back pasture across and very dark.  I am very saddened but wanted to report this because weird things have occurred before.  Like our laser lights we would play with our dogs with when we would point them in the field they would disappear at some points but would be seen all the way to the orchards at other points and we! always laughed that it was like something invisible was sucking up th e light at that spot.

20100703,20100707," Cincinnati, OH", light,5 minutes,"Saw unknown persistent light in the sky and then a gray object that arced away when the light stopped.I was out birding Saturday evening at Valley View Preserve.  It was about 935pm.  There were scattered fireworks going off to the south and the northeast but I think it was still a little too light out for people to start setting things off in earnest.  The sky was clear or had a few clouds.  I was looking at and scanning the tree line with binoculars for perched owls when I saw this persistent orange-yellow light in the sky south or southwest hovering in the same spot at maybe 45-50 degrees above the horizon and not flickering.  The light was maybe 2 or 3 times larger than Venus in the sky and certainly way smaller than the moon.  I had no idea what it was but eventually figured it was either a) some kind of firework b) the back of a distant plane/jet or maybe c)the launch of some kind of rocket or something since the last weird thing I saw in the sky, that was kind of similar to this event, was part of an NSA Atlas rocket launch.After a few minutes of shining in exactly the same spot in the sky, the light stopped and I saw this gray, blurry object slowly arc a very short distance east from where the light had been until it faded away or I just lost track of it in the increasing darkness.  The gray object, which I figured was the emitter of the light, was roughly the same size as the light or maybe slightly smaller and possibly top-like in shape.  I watched the whole sequence with and without binoculars but don&apos;t recall the binoculars giving me a much better view of the event except that they more clearly revealed a non-flickering light.  The light was shining for a few minutes and I saw the gray object for probably less than 30 seconds.I don&apos;t know what it actually was but still think it could have been one of the things I thought it might be.  If it was a firework, I&apos;ve never seen anything exactly like it before.  The light looked sort of like a Roman candle if there was just one flare, no smoke trail and the flare stayed in one spot in the sky instead of moving in an arc.  If it was a plane, there should have been blinking lights on the object after the light, it should have moved in a more direct way and I should have heard some sort of sound.  I don&apos;t recall hearing any sounds that I could attribute to the light/object.  And if it was some sort of rocket, it didn&apos;t seem to leave Earth&apos;s atmosphere and was a little different than what I saw before.I had actually completely forgotten about this until Peter Davenport appeared on Coast to Coast AM and am submitting this report per his request.

20100703,20100707," Eddyville, KY", light,20 mins.,"Orb shaped light, steady orange/yellow color, 250+- ft. high, steady speed hoz-hoz, UFO to witnesses.My son, my daughter, and I were watching a public fireworks display on the 3rd of July,  (2010 of course) at apx. 9:PM, on Eddycreek Bay, in Lyon County, Kentucky, when we observed a ball of light passing overhead.The light was not connected to the fireworks show in any way.  The distance between the show and the orb was at least &frac12; mile when we spotted it.  (Judged buy the distance across the bay.)  After the first light passed into the tree line, completely opposite direction of the show, another orb of light came from the horizon behind the fireworks.  It also passed in the opposite direction of the display.Then on July 6th, at apx. 11:PM, my daughter and I saw the same type of light while sitting on our porch; apx. 5-7 miles from the area of the fireworks show on the 3rd.All three orbs were deep yellow to orange in color.  Their luminosity was steady, no pulsation, no fireball or comet-tail appearance.They passed at about the speed of an ultralite, from one horizon to the other.I&rsquo;m judging their height above the ground to be roughly the altitude a search plane might fly.  They definitely did not fly as high as a  passenger plane.None of us could hear a sound coming from it.All three orbs appeared to be about the size of a pea, held at arms length.  So what size that might be, relative to their apparent distance, someone with a degree in the sciences will have to calculate; I am not well educated in that area.",

It is several acres of park ground with an outdoor stage for concerts, etc. We were seated in lawn chairs on the west side of the park/stage area.  A few feet to the west of us is a street, on the other side of which is Addison Airport for small planes.  As part of the festivities there were flyovers by vintage war airplanes, circling the park area.  The wind section of the symphony was playing music on the stage as the vintage planes occasionally circled the park.  Our chairs were facing the stage, a few yards to our southeast, with the airport behind us.  I do not know the time, but it was still light, approximately 8- 8:30 pm.I happened to notice and began to watch something bright orange, somewhat circular in shape, approaching from the behind the stage (from the south) travelling in a straight line to the northwest, crossing over the Addison airport.I pointed it out to my friend and we both watched as a 2nd object appeared behind the first one.  The two objects flew silently in a straight line from south to northwest.  There was nothing unusual about the flight pattern, only that they were bright orange and that I had never seen anything of that color before, and that they were somewhat circular in shape.The vintage planes had been flying at a lower altitude where you could clearly see their shape.  The two orange objects were a lot higher in the sky, but low enough to appear an approximate 4 inch diameter as we viewed it.  They moved quickly.  Our line of sight was about a mile, and it took a couple of minutes for them to disappear from view.We both watched and commented about it. I made a joke that maybe it was ufo&rsquo;s for our 4th of July festivities. They were definitely not airplanes as we know them.I have never seen any kind of ufo before and I didn&rsquo;t think any more about it until I heard your report on Coast to Coast that there were many such sightings on July 4, and I mentally noted that we had seen these objects on July 3, but at a July 4 celebration.There were several hundred people at the event, but I only know of my friend and I who actually watched these 2 objects.",

It was moving quickly in an arc heading towards the northeast, faster than any of the aircraft that were visible but too slow to be a meteor.  The orb had an appearance similar to a circular charcoal briquet, with the center slightly flickering as it moved.  It was not very bright at all, as a landing light on a plane would be, and its circular shape was sharply defined. It did not leave a trail of any type or make any sound.  I watched it until it disappeared behind the roof of my house.  I ran to the front yard, but was unable to locate it again.  I cannot say how high it might have been except that it did not seem to be as high as a satellite.

Object stopped in the distance then returned to original location when fireworks resumed.Remarks: My son another, and myself were watching the fireworks display when my son pointed out an object that appeared to be hovering in the air. I looked up at it and it was unusual in both color and shape. The ambient noise made it impossible to determine if there was any associated engine noise, but the object was indeed unusual. For the time that we observed it, it moved several times. The impression was that it was demonstrating an interest in the fire works, and we discussed the possibility of it being a helicopter or balloon/dirigible observing the firework display.  My son pointed out that the lighting was not correct for either.  Upon conclusion of the firework display, the object traveled quite fast to the east where we lost sight of it.  We then walked over to a local dinner approximately a 15-minute walk.  Before entering the dinner, I looked back in the direction of where the object had been and it had returned.  This coincided with the start of another towns&rsquo; commencing of! a fireworks display.Several weeks later, I check with the Parks Department of Red Bank for any information concerning the possible photographing of the fireworks display from an airborne platform.  The individual that I spoke with was unaware of any photo operation.

We are all professionals between 35 and 56 years old.  We were watching fireworks around the lake from the dock.  We saw 3 separate sightings of similar UFO objects about 15 minutes apart-they were NOT an aircraft that anyone could identify-no flashing lights typical of aircraft, movements were not typical of planes, and no airplane noises were heard.The objects sight came from the horizon at the south-west (the first object came from a point furthest to the west compared to the other two) and traveled northerly up the lake pulsating a orangish/red glow. Their sizes at their largest point was about twice that of Venus, which was visible just above the western horizon and at least as bright if not brighter.  Each time, their altitudes were at least a few thousand feet (guessing-based on the height of the surrounding hills from the water).Most of their movements were similar in character to each other with erratic speed (fast then slow) and motions -veering off to one side or the other, sometimes instantly reversing their direction - sometimes appearing to stop or hover along their mainly northern route before continuing. None of the movements were super-fast.All three sightings ended similarly in that they appeared to stop in about the same location to our south (distance unknown and very difficult to even guess) although their routes to get to that area were slightly different.  After being stationary a few seconds-they got brighter and brighter then began to move south and upward slowly (in relation to our position) as their light dimmed and then vanished.  The second object re-appeared briefly (and dully) after a second or so of turning south disappearing, remaining visible for one or two more seconds again - which helped to verify that it was still moving after we lost sight of it before it then vanished.The first sighting was approximately 5-6 minutes long, with the second and third being a little over 4 minutes.",

He agreed that this was a strange red light indeed.  We live below a flight path of the airport so we often see incoming planes in the distance, but usually the planes we see have many red and white lights that are constantly flashing.  This object had one big red glowing light (perhaps a distant orb but all we could see was a bright red light).  We talked about the possibility of a satellite, but it was so red, and seemed much closer.It moved slowly across the sky.  There were occasional fireworks coming from either side of the sighting, but the object was in a clearing between the two houses launching the fireworks.  The light moved too slowly, too horizontally, and too straight to be a stray firework.After a minute or two of watching it move across the sky, I ran into the house to get my glasses.  The light was moving slow enough that I figured I would have time to get my glasses before the view of the light would be blocked by the trees.  To my surprise, the red light had stopped completely in its tracks. My husband and I continued to stare at the red light, as it seemed to hover in one spot.  It was completely still.  We discussed the possibility of a distant helicopter, but it was silent and completely unwavering.

It was approximately 9:25 pm or so when I sat down at the table and I was watching the neighbors down the block blowing off some fireworks in the distance.  I got up and walked to the back of the yard so I could see if I could see any other fireworks going off.  As I looked over the front of my house, I seen this object coming toward me. It was orange in appearance, and was almost like glowing, like an aura around it or something. It made no noise what so ever.  It was almost silent, but looked almost like it was spinning the body part of it, but was just moving forward.  It was the strangest thing!  I started freaking out, and yelled for my boyfriend.   As he came over it was now almost right over the front of our house. It wasn&rsquo;t very high in the sky maybe a couple hundred feet above our trees.  He ran into the house, and tried to grab the camera, but by the time he came back it was alre! ady over our neighbors house, and hidden by their trees.I kept watching in the sky, turning in circles hoping I would see it again.

As the airplane headed toward this unidentified object it went back up in the sky, and the lights seem to disappear, or go off.  The aircraft then was over the spot where this craft was, and went passed it. I thought it was gone but then it came down out of the clouds but behind my house in the sky.  This time the craft came down and had it&rsquo;s lights out and seemed to be a bit bigger than the other one that went over my house.  I could clearly see this space craft because of the street lights behind m! y house in the court. It was clearly a flying saucer, disk shaped.  It was grey, silverfish looking,  and was flying quietly. It was moving very slowly like hovering, or scoping things out.  Then it began to speed up and looked like it was coming down.  It was flying like it was looking for a place to land, or  something .

In my career I have seen many strange things, but this observation clearly tops them all as far as being unexplained.   On July 4, 2010, at approximately 2145 to 2155 hours, I was sitting near the bank of the Missouri River on the 300 Block of River Drive North in Great Falls Mt.  I was sitting with my family waiting for the city fireworks display that was set to start at approximately 2200 hours.  We were sitting on the east side of the river facing westbound where the fireworks display was going to be launched.As we were waiting for the show I noticed an aircraft flying eastbound over the city (Est. elevation 10,000 feet high).  Normally this would not be note worthy because we were sitting under the flight path of airplanes landing and taking off from the Great Falls International Airport.  This particular craft caught my attention because it appeared to flying too high to have just taken off from the runway.  Normally, I have noticed flights that don&rsquo;t land at the airport fly on the outskirts of the city.  Also, I noticed an extremely large glowing yellow/reddish color light underneath the aircraft.  The light took up the whole diameter of the craft.  The light appeared to be the approximate size of a Boeing 747.  I observed no red or green tail or wing lights on the craft.  There was no apparent spotlight shining in front of the craft.  I also could not hear the craft&rsquo;s engine.  It should be noted it was extremely windy and this could have had an effect on the sound waves reachi! ng my location.  The craft also appeared to be flying slower than a jet craft would have at that altitude that was not planning on landing.At this time, I pointed the craft out to my wife.  At the same time we both said we have never seen an airplane or helicopter that looked like that.  We debated over whether a satellite would have the same characteristics.  During this time there were approximately 15 people that were sitting near us on the riverbank.  Several of them were watching the craft also.  Some of their conversations were similar in nature to ours (Unknown names of the other witnesses).I continued to watch the craft as it continued eastbound until I lost site of it as it headed east past the city.  Great Falls has Malmstrom Air Force Base, Homeland Security Base, and the Montana Air National Guard.  My job has allowed me some access to these bases on occasion.  To my knowledge, none of the aircraft they fly looks like this.  After hearing about similar related sightings of this nature on July 4th on Coast to Coast, I felt compelled to pass on my observations.  I hope this information will help, I just wish there could be an explanation for what we observed.",

Note that what I am reporting as &quot;fireballs&quot;, &quot;glowing lights&quot;, or hovering spheres, are not the likes of any firework which I am familiar with.Around 9:15 p.m., a friend and I sat on my back porch watching fireworks displays from various neighborhoods around us.  We set off a few of our own, but nothing big.  Neither of us had any alcoholic beverages that day or night, nor do we do drugs; our states of mind were as sharp and relaxed as possible.When looking south, during a lull in the fireworks, we both noticed (and promptly pointed out to each other) 4 objects in the dark sky.  We were looking at about a 35 degree angle of elevation.  The objects seemed to hover in place, making only minuscule adjustments to hold formation due to strong winds.  They glowed with an orange-red light, the closest approximation of which I can make is the HTML Hex code #CC1100.  It was not an extremely strong glow, in that I could not see it illuminating any objects on the ground, trees, or even that much of the smoke present from the fireworks.  However, it was clearly bright enough (or close enough) to reach my friend and I with no problem.  They were arranged in what looked from our viewpoint to be the shape of a rhombus or diamond shape, but I cannot say for sure due to our angle and imperfect depth perception concerning their distance from one another.  They seemed to act together, as though they were all present for the same cause or of! the same force.Other similar formations could be seen from the front of my home looking northward; one directly north and one in the north-northwest.  The latter formation was at a greater distance from us, causing the glows to appear smaller and sort of blend together, creating uncertainty on the number in that formation.  We could only assume that there were also four there, as this is how the others were arranged.The formation to the south was still closest to us, and we mainly observed it.  It remained still, emitting no beams or objects, but the objects seemed to alternate positions every 45 min. or so.  About 5 min. after a rotation, the object closest to us (on a the point of the rhombus) darted towards us significantly. It hovered now above the pond directly behind my house.  It faded in color and luminescence as it neared, becoming completely matte black by the time it reached us.  It hovered there, and had it not been for fireworks on the horizon and city lights illuminating the haze, it would have blended easily into the night sky.  We had a Nikon D5000 with an external flash and telephoto lens, and immediately started fumbling for it to try to capture it on camera.  The camera would not boot up.It usually takes about half a second to turn on and become ready to shoot, if that.  But it wouldn&apos;t. The battery was charged, for we tried two of them, both of which had been charged that day.  It was in the right way and there should have been nothing to interfere.  In the dark, I tried to use my lighter to see if there was some fault or something that could prevent it from working.  It was a push-button or electronic butane aerosol lighter, where one clicks a button down, creating a spark, and igniting a jet of butane fuel.  The fuel came out as usual when the button was depressed, but the spark would not work. Neither would my friend&apos;s.We took this to mean that after going into some sort of less detectable mode, it also activated a device that shut down certain electronic capabilities within a reasonable proximity.  Unable to capture it, we could only stand in awe.  It looked to be about 15 ft. in diameter, and rotating a bit in one direction before reversing its spin. It spun fairly slowly, almost like it was just drifting there.  After about 3 min. of suspension, it flew back to its formation.  It did not change color, but by the time the craft got back, the formation was then the same shade of matte black.  It was unbelievable how...black it really was. It seemed to just suck in all light.  There were minor indentations around the craft, visible when not luminous, around the &quot;equator&quot;.  Just short dashes, impressed into the material. This allowed us to notice the rotation before.After reforming, the formation flew northward at unnatural speeds.  There was no time for acceleration. It was just...going.  It went from a stop to its desired speed immediately and remained steady at that speed until arriving near the northern formations.  They joined to form a loose squarish shape. This larger formation flew northward while gaining altitude at a steady pace.  I can&apos;t imagine why only the one formation would go into its &quot;undetectable&quot; or stealth mode while in the larger formation, but it remained that way during its exit.My friend has done no real research into ufology or related fields, and previously was just oblivious.  He had no opinion.  He always took a tolerant, but non-believing, attitude towards matters like this. I have read numerous books, online articles, and viewed a vast amount of serious multimedia on the subject, including photographs, video recordings, and audio clips.  I don&apos;t consider myself to be a serious researcher by any means, but I do take matters of this nature seriously.",

This time the light was in a southwest position near the Aurora bridge and possibly 2 miles high in the air, I would say equal distance above Lake Union between Queen Ann hill and Fremont.  It seemed to hover in this area for 5 minutes and was much larger than an airplane light.

We decided to get up and walk down the block for whatever reason.About seven minutes later, we heard a very faint noise above us and saw the &quot;strobe&quot; light again as we were still walking towards the boardwalk.  From what I recall, the light was white-colored (it was sort of like what a helicopter beam light looks like when they&apos;re searching for someone).  The beam of light went over us and we all saw it touch the sidewalk.  After this the ufo or whatever it was started to take off slowly then reached a faster speed as it flew off into the distance.Keep in mind that all of us were completely sober when we saw this.  Also, when we looked up we couldn&apos;t really see what color the actual flying object was, but it had a green square colored light on the bottom of it.  Behind the green square of light was the weird white-ish strobe light thing that would actually reach down and hit the sidewalk.The next day, I later found out that my friends from Rockport, MA, saw the same exact thing!

20100704,20100705," North Bend, NE", unknown,Minutes,"&quot;Burning&quot; flying object passes at least 3 times east of North Bend, Nebraska, USAObject sighted:  Yellow-orange flying object which appeared to be &quot;burning&quot; from the quality of the light.Location:  North Bend, Nebraska, USA  Direction:  East Angle of view:  Approximately 30 degrees above the horizon.My family and I spotted a flying object flying almost exactly north, in the sky east of North Bend, Nebraska. The sighting took place on July 4th, 2010.  My wife and I were lighting fireworks in the back yard of her parents&apos; house when suddenly the people at the house started talking and pointing to the east.  They called out to me, &quot;What is that?&quot; I saw a light moving far in the distance. Initially I thought it was a helicopter because the light seemed to flicker, like the flame of a candle.  However it was high and very fast and the light seemed to be one of burning, and not an electric halogen bulb like you see on modern aircraft.  Additionally, there were no red and white strobe lights that are standard on regulation aircraft (we could clearly see these on commercial aircraft passing at cruising altitude high overhead).  It continued north (it had first been spotted to the southeast of us), and the light didn&apos;t really change as our perspective of it did as it passed (i.e., there was no dimming effect like you might get from headlights passing you as the craft eclipses its lights, etc.).It was flying quickly, at least the speed of a large helicopter or a plane. After a minute or so it was across the sky, and northeast of us, when it rather quickly faded out of sight entirely. This was surprising to us because we were seeing commercial jets far over head and could clearly make out their blinking red and white lights over an altitude of at least 15,000 feet.The object (or a second one, identical to the first) appeared again about 15 to 20 minutes later, again in the southeast.  It followed the exact same flight pattern as the previous, vanishing again in what we can say at best was the same spot as before.A third and identical sighting took place roughly an hour after the first one.  By the third time it came around, we had gone inside to get some binoculars. The object was difficult to focus on, but the characteristics of the light coming from the object was more akin to the flame of a candle than the steady shine of an electric source.  I&apos;d say it was about 10 times brighter at least than the brightest star in the sky at that point, and perhaps three times the diameter of any of the stars.  My father in law was able to track it in his binoculars, and describes that it seemed like a round object, like looking at a disc on its side or perhaps a sphere, with the burning light coming from around the perimeter of the circumference.All in all, the sightings took place between 10:00 pm and 11:00 pm, US Central time.There were 6 adults and 2 young children at that house, and we all saw it each time.  After the third one, my father-in-law and I went next door to see if the neighbor had seen the same thing.  She and her two grandsons had seen it during one of the fly-overs.  She thought at first that it was a basket from a hot air balloon, saying that the light&apos;s quality made her think of the hot air generator present in such balloons. But she quickly realized it was moving far too fast to be a balloon.The object&apos;s trajectory was more or less level across the sky, parallel to the ground for an apparent distance of several miles, except at the end it could possibly have been increasing altitude, but hard to say without any precise measurements.The following day (July 5th), we communicated with some family who live in Wichita, Kansas, and they saw the same object flying in the same direction.Though the light was the brightest thing in the sky (the moon was not visible at this time), we heard no sound from the object on any of the three passes, only the sound of fireworks across town.  Also there was not much wind that day, so the object(s) appeared to have had to be flying under their own power.",

It definitely looked man-made because it appeared to have flames on the bottom, but it was so high up that it could not have been a normal kind of fireworks.  The fact that we could detect flames even though it was so high up made us think the actual &quot;object&quot; had to be fairly large.  It traveled at a speed that was like if you watch the ISS go over or something like that except that it was much closer to earth than that (the ISS) or even satellites.

I was looking at the sky facing south when my attention was drawn to a very bright reddish light low in the sky. It was about the size of a star, but it was the brightest thing in the sky. I watched if for about 2-3 seconds, before I realized it was obviously moving directly toward my position. It was getting visibly closer and appearing larger by the second.I called my son&rsquo;s attention to it, and he also saw it. By this time it was not quite directly over our heads. I got a very good look at it. It appeared to be a round ball of reddish orange flame.  It definitely had the appearance of flames, but there was no visible smoke or sparks. It was completely silent and moving in a straight line, south to north.  I saw no visible structure of any type. There was no noticeable wind blowing at the time.It passed almost directly over our heads. I turned around so I could continue to watch it as it passed by me on its way north.  After watching it for a few seconds now from behind it, I saw it make a little series of zigzag movements, right, left, then right left, again.  It then continued heading off to the north in a straight line until it disappeared from my sight.It was impossible for me to accurately estimate the speed, size, or altitude, in the dark sky. If I was going to guess based on my gut feeling, I feel it was smaller (less than 3 ft. in diameter), rather than a large object and at a few hundred feet elevation, rather than higher. It was moving quickly relative to its size.  The total time I watched it was about 20-30 seconds, maybe slightly longer.There are a couple of things I am sure it wasn&rsquo;t. It wasn&rsquo;t a firework, like a rocket or mortar. It was totally silent, slower, and left no trail. It also did not look like any flare I have seen either.

Animated movie from prior sighting of 1997.We call this event &quot;The July Orb&quot; because we have witnessed this twice before, all in July.The event this year, 2010, was over Bothell, WA.  An orange, glowing orb silently and smoothly cruised from North to South in the same way a satellite would move, but was only as high up as a helicopter would fly. Myself, two other adults and two children also saw it.My camera was at the ready to photograph our fireworks and to pause light in the sky, and I was able to take a photograph!  The camera zoom is a 12x.  While the photo shows a tail, this is only due to the shutter being open as the orb moved.   The falling tail in the photo is due to me trying to find it to focus. Perhaps someone can figure out the size of this orb and it&apos;s speed based on these details!  Our neighbor came by and as I showed him the picture and explained what we saw he asked &quot;Do you mean like THAT!?&quot; Pointing up, there was the same thing, moving in the same direction.HISTORY Event 1: I first saw this same orb over Bothell WA, July 1997, and called Mr. Davenport to report it. I was so amazed that I created an animated version because it was hard for others to believe there was no other way to describe it other than a mystery object.  It also moved North to South, slowing and silently gliding.  However, the object was closer than the described 2010 event as I could see it pass behind trees in front of me.Event 2: July 2009, Couer D&apos;Alene Idaho, 11 or 12 pm. My husband and my sister witnessed this same orb while sitting on the dock (south and west end of the lake).  However, it raised vertically from behind a home on the same cove about 6 or 7 houses south, or the trees behind it.  It glided silently and smoothly up, then past them and over the lake and then just disappeared.  The next day they went door to door hoping others had seen this, but no one had.",

It was very high in the air, way too high to be a helicopter with a spot light on, and was definitely not a plane.  I don&apos;t know the exact direction, but it came from the inner harbor area, and went over Patterson Park.  I asked everyone to look up at the light and everyone agreed it was definitely not a helicopter due to how high it was.  It seemed to be in the height of where commercial planes fly, but it was definitely not a plane.  It was about a pen cap size, definitely bigger than a star or a planet you can see with your eyes.  It moved slowly, it didn&apos;t zig or zag, just in a slow fluid way.  Then, towards the end, it was hard to see as it was like it was shimmering out of sight.  You really had to look for it to find it towards the end, then it just disappeared.  It was a clear night with barely any clouds in the sky so it wasn&apos;t like it disappeared behind a cloud.The light, was very solid in the center, then it was like a very slight black ring, and more light, almost like a halo around the center light.

We did see a plane at one point, as well as a helicopter.  Then, seemingly appearing out of nowhere, my mother and I saw an orange-red orb flying towards our house.At first we thought it might be the lights on an airplane because it was flying so smoothly, but as it moved closer we speculated it might be a flare or firework of some kind.  However, it was moving slowly, and the light wasn&apos;t diminishing in intensity at all.  There was no trail behind it--it was an entirely self-contained light.  As it flew over our house, we both noticed smaller lights that seemed to be circling around the larger light.  The smaller lights, to me, looked to be pink and green in hue (among other colors.)  I only got a clear look at it for a couple of seconds.We ran to the back of the house, out onto our deck, and watched as it flew slowly over the pine trees and over the neighborhood behind us.  Again, it didn&apos;t explode or diminish as fireworks might. It made no sound whatsoever.We ran inside and downstairs to inform my father, then ran back upstairs to watch it circling around and taking a similar path over the house for a second time.  I ran to get my camera, but the battery was dead.  I hooked up the family camcorder quickly so that it was pulgged into the wall and not running on a battery, but it was behaving strangely and kept shutting off.  We watched as the object disappeared over the house a second time.  I went to charge the other camera while my parents watched the object take its route over the back of the house again.  My father initially suggested it might be a flare, and then admitted he had no idea what it really was.My mother and I are confident we saw something out of the ordinary.

Moving at speed of an airplane but no sound, no &ldquo;structure&rdquo; seen, no blinking/flashing lights and if I recall correctly it was just below the overcast/clouds it may have been &ldquo;reflecting a bit&rdquo; off of them.

This object caught my attention as I happened to be looking SW.  I kept looking with my bare eyes as it traveled closer towards me (initially dismissing it as probable helicopter or plane).When I still couldn&rsquo;t make it out, I took two steps forward , looked down to grab the binoculars and sit (so I could steady my hands) to get closer view&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;but, in the few seconds it took to look down, grab binocs and glance back up&hellip;while trying to feel for the chair&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;it disappeared.

That&rsquo;s a weird part of this occurrence.  The same thing happened last year (and I reported it on this site then -you can view it there) July 4th 2009.  At about same time/diff trajectory.  But,  in 2009 the color and appearance was more like a Hazy Orange glowing basketball/orb- more definitively round with an entirely fuzzy glow emitting from the object itself.  Now-In 2010 the object was definitely Red and I don&rsquo;t think I would describe it as purely &ldquo;round&rdquo; NOR as having a &ldquo;hazy&rdquo; glow&hellip;&hellip;any ambient glow was more of a steady &ldquo;reflection off clouds&rdquo; this time.Sorry my facts aren&rsquo;t exact.  As mentioned, I wasn&rsquo;t going to post this as I find it rather odd that, (1) It happened on Independence Day when millions would likely be looking to the skies.  And (2) Similar events happen two years in a row?  This does not change what I saw &ndash; either year --without a doubt.  But, It makes me suspicious that somebody might be pulling off a big hoax/scam/trick somehow&hellip;.or, some manmade flying thing makes the same trip every year on the 4th?  There were many sightings last year too.I decided to post my observation after I went into your site to see, by chance, if anyone else saw what I saw and was surprised to see one other Streamwood, IL. report.

Its altitude was more like what the local military jets fly.  Its flight speed was also similar to what U.S. jet would be.  Also, it did not emit any noticeable jet, propeller, or helicopter rotor sounds.  Once it was almost out of site, it appeared to increase altitude and head back northerly along the same path.

It appeared coming in from the South West at a very fast speed, than slowing to 150 mph or about the speed of a small plane.  Its altitude was approximately 3,500-4,000 feet.  The size of the object was approximately the size of a blueberry or the end of your small finger and was glowing orange with a plasma haze around it.  The object was consistent with its trajectory vector and color as it traversed across the sky.

It was on a straight flight path the object stayed on the same path and did not divert from the path nor did it slow down or speed up - it remained constant.  Looking with naked eyes, the object appeared to be a very fast moving hot air ballon as it seemed to be glowing orange.  There was no sound that could be heard as it passed overhead.  It did not appear to have a wingspan or any type of other lights you would commonly see on commercial aircrafts.  The object passed over our group twice in the same exact pattern within a matter of 15-20 minutes.  I checked NASA&apos;s website for ISS viewings and there were none listed in our region for that night.

20100705,20100705," Deer Park, OH", changing,45-50 minutes,"Looking NE there was a bright round/triangular object hovering in the sky and moving sporadically; changed in shape, size, &amp; brightnessLast night on Sunday, July 4th, 2010, in Deer Park Ohio (just outside of Cincinnati) at around 10:00pm my mom (medical field), her boyfriend (ex-army officer) and I (student) went outside to look at fireworks.   After a few minutes, my mom&apos;s boyfriend  looked North East and pointed at a bright object in the sky.  At first he thought it was a star of some kind, but it became apparent after a few minutes that it was too large and bright to be a star.  The object appeared to be a ways in the distance, though I couldn&apos;t say the exact miles.  At first it looked rounded in shape and a bright white, though after time it would change in shape and also brightness.  The shape would change from round to almost triangular, would dim and brighten, and would also at time get smaller and the stretch out again.After the three of us arguing about what it could be (approx. 15 minutes later), I noticed more and more that it seemed to be hovering rather than still standing.  From the time we first spotted it, to around 10:20pm it had moved (in comparison) from one end of our house to the other.  After more speculating, I went inside to grab my moms&apos; phone camera and also a small pair of binoculars.  Finally, now having a better view of the hovering object, I honestly cannot tell you what it was.  I&apos;ve never seen any star, aircraft or anything of that sort like that before in my life; both my mom and her boyfriend said the same.  Using the binoculars the object appeared triangular but seemed to have a faint rounded halo around it.  It was bright with in the center but also had small blue/green &quot;lights&quot; (quotation because I don&apos;t know how else to describe them).  Every so often it looked as though there were bright red streaks that would flare out from the object almost like what you wou! ld see on a jet of some sort.  After watching it more closely we started seeing it move sporadically up and down, and to the left.  The movement wasn&apos;t big, but enough so that it was clearly noticeable.The time now was around 10:30pm, and while myself and my mom were still watching it, my mother&apos;s boyfriend got bored and went back into the house.  I really wanted to see if we could get a better view of the object, so I talked my mom into driving closer toward it.  We went down streets and back roads and were able to follow it for quite a ways.  We got a little closer to it, but in the end it was late, and we were too tired to keep driving.  I last saw the strange object at around 10:45-10:50pm when we turned around back toward home.  Once we arrived, now around 11pm, we searched the entire sky around us, (of course including where we first spotted it)  but saw no trace of the strange bright object any longer. It&apos;s as if it just disappeared.Even thinking back on it now, It was like nothing I&apos;ve ever seen before... it was so brilliant and brightly colored, even more than the tiny specks of stars around it. But the shape of it is unlike any air craft I know of. It was and still is incredibly fascinating. Though unfortunately, my moms&apos; phone camera was all we had at the time... So the few pictures we took came out unclear and did not do justice to how amazing it looked with the binoculars aid.  A few photos we did take however, show the relative size as well as it moving (you can clearly see a &quot;tail&quot; or steak behind the object.) If you want the photos I will gladly send them to you. And also, any information you may have as to what this object could&apos;ve been or even if someone around our location reported something similar, we would be most grateful.

When I did I was greeted not by the sky I&apos;d been expecting, but by the dark night sky.  I looked around for the source of the light, and not finding it, I went to get a glass of water.  I figured I&apos;d imagined it. When I came back to bed the light was back, and this time I could see the source.  There was a large, saucer-shaped craft in the sky above the forest behind my house.  It looked almost transparent in the center, and glowed blue around the edges, looking almost jellyfish-like. I stared for a few minutes, stupefied.  As I watched, the center pulsed yellow and! came closer to my window.  I tapped the glass, I don&apos;t recall why, but when I did it pulsed purple very quickly five times and took off.

My store receipt reads that we checked out at 22:10:13.It was the fourth of July and there were many fireworks in the area.  We were driving west.   As we turned south toward our neighborhood, I noticed a red and orange fireball just above the trees to the west.   It seemed to have a red center with a orange misty glow around it.  It was about the height of a street light and from our point of view, the outer glow looked like the size of a basketball.  It was difficult to tell if the &quot;glow&quot; was part of object or due to viewing it through the windshield.I traveled a block south and turned west on a street toward our neighborhood.   I turned a street earlier than I usually do to get a better look at the object.  When I came to the next intersection, 1/2 block distance, we saw the object above a house to the south.  We turned south.  I told my 11 year old son to keep an eye on it as I drove.  I traveled the length of two more blocks (still going south)  and then turned west again.  The object was now above the houses on the south side of the west bound street.  We drove two blocks to our house.  I pulled into the driveway.  My husband was in the yard with the kids.  I jumped out of the car and pointed it out to my husband.  It was south of our house in the sky at about a 45 degree angle and getting small but still too bright to be a star - and it was orange red.  We  watched it get smaller assuming it was getting further away.   It took several minutes before it disappeared.I went inside and the family continued to shoot  fireworks.  I would estimate I was in the house ten minutes when my  son came in and said &quot;Dad needs you.&quot;   When I asked why, my son said, &quot;The orange light is back&quot;.   Sure enough.

My husband reported it moved slightly to the west and then grew small and disappeared again.What drew our attention to the object was the  fourth of July fireworks in our area.   As we were driving home and nearing our neighborhood, we were watching the fireworks.   A large firework in that area lit off but this orange ball didn&apos;t move.   We expected it to explode and it didn&apos;t.   At first I thought it was a street light on fire or a fire in the trees.   Then as it floated above the houses, I wondered if it were a parachute type firework that was on fire and I was concerned about where it was going to land.When we first saw it, it was floating about the height of the street light and below the trees.  It climbed to float above a one story house.  Soon it was above the larger two story houses and when we finally saw it in the distance it seemed to be very high in the sky.We zigzagged in a south and west pattern to our home.

We waited for another but none came.I didn&apos;t think much of it until this morning when I spoke with my daughter (who lives in Festus) and she said she saw the same thing but only one of them.  This prompted me to find this reporting center and make a report.

This light had a red hue. Lasting about 5 seconds it crossed &frac34; of the sky until it disappeared into the distance.  I know it was not an airplane because it was traveling way to fast with no sound.  It was also not a weather balloon because of this factor also.  The conclusive factor I see in this is while as I was watching this light its trajectory curved.  As it crossed the night sky its path curved multiple times.  The curving was not dramatic but very noticeable and smooth. The curving path of this flying light factors out a meteor and a satellite.  Neither of these objects curve like the way this light did that night.

At 8:50 PM we saw a single large reddish orange glowing orb coming from the south moving slowing northward; it was very low, maybe 250 to 300&apos; above the rooftops.  There was absolutely no sound being emitted from the illuminating sphere.  We watched it for about 5-10 minutes as it passed over our neighborhood and then got into our car and drove to the gas station at the corner of Martin and Zerdt roads.  We could see fireworks off in the distance so we sat in the car for about 15 minutes and watched.  As we drove home heading west on Martin Road, we saw a formation of 3 glowing orbs.  This time I really thought, hey these things are extraterrestrial and I want to make sure there not hot air balloons or helicopters.  So we slowed down to almost a complete stop, rolled down the windows to see if we could hear helicopter blades, but there was no sound at all.   And they were not hot air balloons.  We had traffic behind us, so we had to move on and we are not sure where they went, but assume they continued to move northward as did the first one.  We were sitting outside and then around 10 pm we saw one more solitary glowing orb, but at a higher altitude than the others and this one was either blinking, or something behind it was blinking and we watched it move northward as well, then the dog barked, we looked away and when we looked up again it had disappeared.  Then about 15 minutes later my boyfriend said, look at that satellite.  And I said, where?  Then I exclaimed, Wow, did you see that?   He said I sure did, wow!   We saw four distinct bright lights that looked like stars that were in a cluster which was kind of vibrating and then they formed into a line and just zip off into space on at a time very quickly.  It made warp speed seem slow, they just zipped up and off into space and where gone! in an instant.  Neither of us had ever witnessed anything like this before.  We believe that since the orbs were so slow moving and close to the ground there must have been a number of others who saw the same thing on that clear 4th of July night in Huntsville, Alabama.For the skeptics, I looked up sky lanterns and balloons on-line and just wanted to let you know that there was no way the first one or the second set of three that we saw were in any way sky lanterns. These illuminating things  were huge.  They moved steadily and with a purpose.  Not anything similar to a sky lantern and we were close enough to tell that they were not hot air balloons.  My boyfriend thinks they were as large as a VW bug and my estimate is a bit larger.  They did not flicker and produced an energy glow that was supernatural.  This is the first time I have ever looked at a ufo site and ever posted any such thing.  We are both of sound mind and we were not under the influence that night.

20100706,20100706," Belleville, IL", circle,10 minutes,"Unidentified Balls of light fly over Belleville after 4th of July celebration.On the night of the 4th of July I witnessed something in the sky that I could not explain.  Yes, I understand that everyone is shooting fireworks into the sky.  However, what I witnessed I do not believe were fireworks.  I was with a group of friends, some adults and some children.  We were firing off fireworks on a dead end street.  Lots of people in surrounding areas were doing the same. We had just fired off the last of the fireworks and things became quiet for a few minutes.  As I walked into the street I heard one of my friends say, &quot;Hey check out thos!&quot;  As I looked up into the sky, I was expecting to see some more fireworks exploding, only these did not appear to be fireworks.What I saw in the sky that night were small, round, what I considered to be balls of light.  They were a yellowish orange color.  At first there were only 2 that I could see so I continued to watch them.  They were moving constantly at the same speed from the south to the north. These objects were moving horizontally not vertically.  Everyone in our group became fixated on these things. Within seconds we saw more balls of light following. I really started to pay attention at this point.  I asked my friends if they had any idea what they were, although no one had any good ideas.  These things just kept coming from the south and fading off to the north.  I started to take some pictures on my phone because I had no idea what these were.  I don&rsquo;t have a video phone so all I got was still pictures. I wanted to narrow this down to somehow explain this.  These things were not making any noise that I could tell, they all stayed in the same position as they moved by, and they were not moving! fast.  From the time you first saw one it would take at least 1 to 2 minutes until you could not see it anymore.  There was no smoke or con trails behind these objects.  They did not flash or have any lights on them.  These things were round in shape but you could not see any &ldquo;hard&rdquo; lines on them.  They were on what seemed to be a straight line path going from south to north. I did not count them because of the sheer volume of these things.  There had to have been over 100 of these.  They all trailed pretty close behind one another and just kept coming, yet they were not in any pattern or formation.  I would guess that these objects were trailing across the sky over the distance of at least 5 to 10 miles.  From start to finish we watched these things for every bit of 10 minutes. I actually called my girlfriend to ask her if she could see the same thing in a neighboring town, she could not see what we did.  I talked to other friends that were just about 1 mile away from us and they ! said they saw them but thought they were hot air balloons.My friends did not seem to be concerned about this and were saying that there was probably an explanation.  I myself was not satisfied with this. When I got up the next day this was all I could think about.  I started to look on the internet for answers but got none.  I have lived next to an air force base all of my life and have seen many aircraft in the sky yet what I saw that night I cannot explain and I wish I could.  I actually thought that since this was such a huge thing going on in the sky on the 4th of July that it would be all over the news and in the news paper, yet there were no news stories.  I believed that thousands of people had to have witnessed this also, there has to be video of this somewhere, and credible people had to have seen this.What I witnessed that night I still can&rsquo;t explain and I am still looking for answers.  I do not assume that these were &quot;UFOs.&quot;  However until I can find out what they were; they are still UNIDENTIFIED!

My father even talk&apos;s about seeing a cigar shaped UFO while fixing a roof for my grandparents when I was 3 years old.  He saw me on the front lawn when there was a bright light.  My father and his twin brother saw the craft and the light.  I dissapeared for 4 day&apos;s then just showed up on my grandparents front lawn with no explimation.  This was in Chesterfield, UT, June 1960.Then March 1973, my ex-husband and I were driving from Tucson AZ to Salt Lake City.  I was driving and he was sleeping in the back seat.  I remember pulling out of Flagstaff AZ and watching the light behind me turn red.  Next thing I remember is being in Park City Utah. I don&apos;t know how much time had passed because we did not have a clock or watch with us.  No gas had been used and my exhusband was bleeding out of his nose.I for whatever reason was bleeding from my virgina as if on my period.  The bleeding quit almost immidiatly. Five years later I was almost 5 months pregent when I suddenly found myself in the bathroom with blood all over and no longer with child.  I did not go to the doctor for fear of being told I was crazy.  However I do remember holding a little boy that was moving and his head was too big and his neck was extra long.  Why I would remember that I don&apos;t know.I do know that my exhusband was very upset when at the next appointment when the doctor said that I had miscarried.  I have had a history of losing babies.  While I have four children I have had 4 miscarraiges or what the doctor indicated was a misscariage. Each time I was almost 5 months along and then no longer with child. No memmory of losing the baby.  In one case twins.No known reason until recently.  They tell me I have Protine S Diffency with clogaophthy.  And some other unknown genitic disroder they do not understand.  They see it the blood however have no idia what it is.  It is killing me.  Why no one understands.Normally the craft is extreamly large when I do see them.  When they do apear they are large enough for occupation and are disc shaped.  The one time I saw more than one UFO the disk was chasing a craft that looked like a cigar.  There was also a boomarange type craft almost acting like a wing man to the disk shaped craft.  There seemed to be artilary being used because I saw what seemed to be a direct hit to the cigar shaped craft.  They all just winked out.  This incident happen while I lived in Amhurst OH in the summer of 1974.Many times in Tucson AZ we have UFO activity when the Airforce will send aircraft afther the objects.  This happens at least once a year.  We have even been listening to the radio outside and heard reports about a possible UFO then nothing.  I have even been speaking on the phone with my sister when I&apos;ve seen the UFO and then all sort&apos;s of aircraft from the base chasing the UFO right over my house.In May of 2000 I saw a strange craft above the apartment building I was living at and even had a wittness.  A man that also lived there.  He moved the next day without a word. The craft looked to be the size of a 50 gallon drum.  It just floated there.  No sound. No lights.Now the crafts are extreamly small.  No larger than my finger nail.  The 1st time I saw one that small was in Salt Lake City, Utah when I went for a funerl in March of 2008.  Then in July 4th, 2009 in Phoenix AZ.  June 29, 2010 in Tucson, AZ I saw it again. I&apos;ve seen it six times sense then. I am very delighted yet concerned.  Each time this happens seems to be when a storm is comming about or just ended.  There will be small flashes from the object of different colors.  They hang around for about 10 to 15 minutes.  If I go into the house they come right up to the patio door and stay there.The one this morning it was clear weather when I took my little grandaughter outside to play in the backyard. One of the miniture UFO&apos;s actually landed on my little grandaughter.  She is 21 months old.  When I tried to grab it my hand went right through it.  I picked her up and brought her in the house.  The craft just hovered at the door.  Why if my hand went through the thing does it stay outside.

This object was going from approximately north to south. It disappeared by just going away in the distance. Also, it the light was not brought on by the sunset, as the sun was already down for the night.To give an estimate of how large this object may have been if on the ground it is hard to say, but my estimate would probably be in the 25-30 feet range, the height maybe 8 feet or so.

They appeared to be independent - (not connected to one another). They were to my right and forward of my position.  They were roughly 600&rsquo; high and clearly visible.  There are several airfields in this area, so at first I thought little of the lights - but the color was a distinctly different orange color, very different from any surrounding lights in the area. They were about as bright as a small plane&apos;s landing light.  There were no aircraft strobes, tail beacon, or nav lights.All 3 lights were approximately the same distance apart, with 2 in front, and 1 in the rear.  They appeared to be moving together very slowly in a north, north east direction - very smoothly.  My view became obscured momentarily due to a line of trees on the right side of the highway. Once past the tree line and the lights were back in view, the rear light appeared to just go out.  I fully expected to see some kind of craft (airplane, balloon, etc.) where the rear light had been, but there was nothing.  I then lost sight of them since I had past them by then.

We like to stargaze and took our recliners out into the pasture where we could get a good view of the entire night sky.  We had our radio.  This was at 10pm  sometime between 10 and midnight we saw three strange flashes.  There were three incidences:  two we both saw and one my husband alone saw.The first one my husband alone saw. He said what he saw was an extremely bright flash of light, right between the two bottom stars of the big dipper.  By time he said &quot;oh wow!&quot; and pointed, it had disappeared.  It wasn&apos;t streaking like a meteor. He said it just got bright and disappeared.A while later, maybe 20 minutes to a half hour later I was watching a satellite cross the sky.  I pointed it out to my husband, &quot;I see one!&quot;.  It was directly in front of us.  We both were watching it. As it crossed, it suddenly got extremely bright. So bright the light from it almost hurt my eyes the way high beams from an oncoming car would. It lasted no more than two seconds and them dimmed.  After it dimmed you could no longer see the satellite at all.  I thought maybe it had burned up in space.  There wasn&apos;t an object to track across the sky any longer.  I thought maybe because of the brightness I just couldn&apos;t see it anymore, but it was really gone!  My husband said that was what he had seen earlier.We saw a third one which wasn&apos;t nearly as bright as the first one I had witnessed.  The third one happened the same way.  Visually tracking a satellite across the sky, this one was further to our North (our right hand side, our chairs were facing West).It brightened, then disappeared completely from the sky.After hearing reports on the radio last night, July 6th, about others seeing something unusual, I was compelled to write.  We sat out briefly last night and something unusual again.At around 10:20 we saw the same thing again.  While tracking a satellite across the sky we saw it brighten significantly and then disappear.  This was not as bright as the first one I saw on July fourth.  Maybe 15 minutes later we both saw what looked like two satellites traveling North one behind the other quite close (I have NEVER seen that before).  We watched as the one behind then gradually changed direction heading East as the first one continued North.I am 52 years old. I don&apos;t drink and I have been watching satellites cross the night sky since my early twenties when a friend pointed them out to me while camping.  I know the difference between a high flying plane and a satellite.  I have watched hundreds of satellites cross the sky and I have NEVER EVER seen this kind of thing before.

It was very late approx 1 AM.  I was on a farm market road.  There was no traffic. I was walking along and looked up and saw a airplane I could hear.  I saw a very bright light flying beside the plane, the plane was a comercial plane.  I watched it a minute or so and looked back where I was walking.  A few secound later I look back up and it is flying behind the plane.  I looked back down and then back up and it was flying beside it again. The hair on my neck stood up.  I was honestly scared.  I saw a house about 3-4 hundred yards off the highway with lights on.  I decided to go to it to see if I might use the phone to call my recruiter to come and pick me up.  I had to go over 4 bobwire fences to get to the house.  I knocked on the door and a very harsh voice asked who is it.  I asked to use the phone.  He yelled out you better get out of here before I shoot you.  I didn&apos;t waist any time leaving. I crossed over 2 of the fences in a run and as I was going over the third fence I heard shots and heard pellets landing all around me.  From there I cannot tell you anything.  The next thing I remember is being in my recruiters car and pulling into his driveway.  I cannot tell you how I got in his car, how I contacted him to get him to pick me up in his car.  I cannot tell you going over the forth fence or getting on the highway.  When we were pulling up in his driveway it was just starting to get light outside.

I told him my story and this thing I have in my body.  It&apos;s a tiny spot like a ball.  They told me they were putting together a bus with Xray equipment and would come and Xray this spot and see if it might be a implant.  I told him I can show him lights in the sky every clear night that I cannot explain.  I promise you they are not of this earth.  You can&apos;t just look up and see them, there is a way to do it to be able to spot them.  These lights do very strange things that aircraft doesn&apos;t do.

She thought it was a tower light until she realized there is no tower there.  By the time we looked up in the sky again, it was gone.  I guess it was there for about 5 or 10 minutes.  I&rsquo;m not really sure.  I saw it twice from the front yard and it hovered in the sky long enough for me to snap the photos and walk to the back yard. It was really just an orange-red glowing ball that did nothing but hover in the sky.  It seemed larger than a star but not as large as the moon.  Nothing weird happened, nor were there any strange feelings or happenings associated with it.  There were lots of fireworks going off all over the neighborhood.

From this vantage point we could see about eight different shows.   When we first reached the top of the hill the fireworks had not yet begun, but as I scanned the horizon anyway I saw what looked like the orange lights of an oil drill rig out far in the ocean.  What was strange about it was that there are no oil drill rigs ever visible in my area, also it was far above the horizon which made me sure that it was airborne and was not floating in the ocean.  At this time I had pointed the object out to all the members in my group, they all confirmed this: we all saw five perfectly round spherical looking orange lights that seemed to be in a triangular position aimed in our direction( it would have been pointed northeast from the beach of orange county)we were staring westward out over the ocean.  As the show started we all noticed the lights raise up into the marine layer clouds.  During the show it seemed to poke out once but only with three lights visible. When the firework show was over, we noticed that all five lights in triangular position were once again visible and that it still seemed to be pointed in from the coast(north-east).  We stared  about 15 minutes at this until we decided walk home.  Back at home, I myself looked at the horizon since my interest was peaked, but the lights were completely gone, I noticed this at 22:30.

I was looking up at the sky watching the fireworks, when I observed a very subtle red/orange shaped object moving from south south west to north north east at a very high rate of speed.  Actually the red/orange colored looked like more like an aura around a dark center.  It was too fast to be a normal satellite but slower than most shooting stars.  It wasn&apos;t bright like other objects in the sky and just barely noticeable.  One would have had to be looking right at it to notice it.  It was one of those cases of just happening to be looking at the right place at the right time.  The odd thing was that at one point it appeared to slow down and then speed up again. It never changed its course though.  The trajectory was very straight.To give you some background on me, I was a police officer for eight years before being medically retired.  What I saw wasn&apos;t a normal satellite like I see in the sky all the time.

I watched it because it was unusually large and near to the earth.  The object suddenly began to fade away at a rapid speed and then turned red and disappeared altogether. Later that night, I saw four or five other bright objects zoom through the sky at an insane amount of speed.  Some of the objects would disappear and then reappear and others would turn from gold to gray.  At about 3:00am on the 8th of July I saw a brilliant light that appeared to be a golden magnetic energy rise from the earth until about two hundred feet off the ground at which point it stopped emitting the gold light and began to blink in a manner very similar to a commercial jet.  The object then blinked a pattern of red, green and blue lights, turned in my direction and then flew over my head.  I was unable to discern its shape.  It then flew away and as the distance between it and me increased, the blinking lights made the object look like a shimmering star.  But if you scrutinized it closely, you could tell it wasn&rsquo;t a star, but some form of advanced technological cloaking device.  Then I noticed there were other &ldquo;stars&rdquo; in the sky that blinked in a similar fashion.  As I watched these objects, some of them moved slowly through the sky, while others zoomed at very high speeds.  Then they objects would settle down again and mimic the stars.July 8th 2010, Dusk.Due to the prior night&rsquo;s events, I found a good viewing spot (the top of a hill in Wedgewood) and began watching the sky much earlier. From this vantage point I witnessed hundreds of these &quot;stars&quot; crept across the firmament and descended ever so slowly from the real stars to earth.  They moved so slowly that if I hadn&rsquo;t been anticipating the event and patiently watching, I never would have noticed. But I did notice.  And as the ships reached Earth the sun went down.  But just before it was totally dark, I caught a brief glimpse of one of these ships.  To my surprise it resembled a very sophisticated space-plane. It hummed soothingly.  The other ships then came in my direction traveling slow and low, but keeping their lights in a fashion as to mimic commercial jets.  Occasionally the light pattern would change into a sudden brilliant display of undulating red, green, blue and gold lights.  The ships then circled around Seattle for an hour or so, at which point some of them scattered! out in all directions, while others settled in the sky and mimicked the stars.  I stayed up all night watching the ships that remained.  Some had three lights and appeared to be triangular; others had four lights and appeared to be square. I got some footage with my cell phone.  But the quality is pretty low.  Also, they knew when I was about to take a picture because almost every time I raised my camera, they would change from what they were doing with the lights back to a commercial jet pattern.  I talked out loud and it was as if they could hear me.  For a while nothing particularly obviously out of this world happened. So I said, &quot;Okay, I&rsquo;ll but my camera away.&quot;  Then the ship nearest me did a good deal of rapid blinking and all of a sudden, to the south, I saw a golden light arise over Capitol Hill.  It neared me. When it flew past, I saw that it was another ship that had just come in.  Then I walked home and went to bed.",

The strange noises sounded as if there were hard droplets, hail, or a large amount of pecans falling onto my roof and sidewalk from trees outside.  Being concerned that a thunderstorm was blowing in, I stood up from the computer and went to the window to look through the blinds to see outside.When I peeked through the blinds, the strange sounds immediately stopped.  I looked into the yard and into the street across the way to see if rain drops or hail were falling.  Not seeing any drops of rain or hail, I then looked out onto the horizon to see if there were any thunderstorm clouds, and immediately saw a series of strange lights directly south approximately 15 degrees on the horizon.At first, the lights appeared to be three landing lights on the front of a large airplane heading north. What was strange about this apparent airplane was that it was banked downward as if it were about to turn to the west, but it did not move from this position.  The lights were all of the same amber color, with the two outermost lights the brightest, the center light more dim.  The craft stayed stationary as if it were parked in the sky at an angle.  The other odd thing about this craft was that it seemed to be extremely large, and located approximately 5 or 6 miles southward near the junction of the Dallas North Tollway and I-35.  An estimate of the size was approximately 300 or 400 feet across (huge).Then, incredibly, another craft of similar proportions (but further in the distance), suddenly appeared to the left of the first craft, and it was banked at a different angle compared to the first craft.  The sudden appearance of the second craft was immediate, as if a light switch or strobe had been turned on.  My immediate thought was that there was some sort of fireworks or laser light show being given near the American Airlines Center near downtown.  Then, incredibly, a third craft, immediately appeared to the right, with the same proportions, but at a different distance than the other two craft.  The third craft was also banked at a different angle compared to the others.  It was difficult to discern whether the crafts were actually moving very slowly, or if they were completely stationary.Then, each craft blinked its lights off and on (the three lights of a craft in unison) as if the crafts were communicating with each other.  The blinking seemed to be in a sequence, as if each craft was a separate ornament on a Christmas tree.  The sequential blinking lasted less than 1 or 2 seconds.  All of the lights disappeared as suddenly as they had appeared, but not at the same time (each craft &quot;turned-off&quot; at different times).All of the above took place on the order of about 10 seconds.

I was visiting my cousins and we were outside shooting fireworks until about 11:30.  These particular lights caught my eye because they seemed to be much higher and traveling much faster (and more deliberately) than anything else in the sky.  I thought they were flares with the usual red color distorted by smoke traveling horizontally dues to a light wind we had.  After reading some of the other area sighting, however, I am having second thoughts.The lights resembled the video of the Phoenix lights I have seen in luminosity and color.  The traveled though the air, one following the next, at the same velocity and same altitude.  I only saw them briefly and didn&rsquo;t think much of it at the time and went back to blowing stuff up.  We shot off and watched a lot of fireworks that night but these lights definitely caught my eye due to how unusual and out of place they were.Later that night on our way back home to Bellingham I saw a single light, just like the two I saw about an hour earlier in Bothell , in the Marysville area while driving on I-5.  Identical in every way except that it was alone and appeared to be stationary.  I, again, wrote it off as a flare, even commenting to my wife how thick the firework smoke must be to distort the color so much.With the other reports I&rsquo;m starting to think what I saw may have been something else since it resembles what other witnesses report seeing around the same time frame in the same vicinity.",

When it disappeared behind the tree line, it seemed to us to be maybe a half mile away, and we sped up to what we thought would be the scene of a crash site.Of course, there was no crash, and we tuned in a local radio station to see if there had been an airplane crash in the area.  There was none.This area is across the Hudson River from Stewart Air base, now a commercial airport, and we are both very used to seeing fairly low commercial and military planes, including the huge C-5 Galaxy military transport planes.We only saw the lights for at best 3 seconds, and other than the fact that there were several colored lights which seemed to be along the fuselage of what we thought was the plane (which is unusual) the only thing we could reasonably come up with was that it was a large commercial jet.  Both of us agree there were white, green, and red lights.I&rsquo;m reporting this because it isn&rsquo;t possible for a plane of that size to be going that fast in a vertical position straight down, that close to the ground, and not crash.  Neither of us can explain how that would be possible, so we&rsquo;ve questioned if what we saw was a plane.

I could see them from my front walkway but not from where I was when I got near my car as my neighbor&rsquo;s homes were in the way.  They were slightly to the East of due South.  I&rsquo;d say they were at 15 degrees as far as elevation goes.  Since there were 4 of them and the color was different than the aircraft I see flying into PDX I decided to look at them a little closer. I held still, trying to discern any movement amongst any of the lights using the roof lines of my neighbor&rsquo;s home as a reference.  I detected no movement and it crossed my mind that they could be stars.  Then I thought about it and looked for other stars in the sky and they were nowhere near the brightness or the color.  As far as brightness goes I would say maybe 10 times as bright as a normal star, and maybe half as bright as the lights I see on the commercial aircraft flying in and out of PDX.  Also they were smaller than the lights of the commercial aircraft appear.  So, I go to my car, which was closer to my neighbor&rsquo;s and just make a note of it in my head in case I hear an explanation on the news.Coming out of my car, I heard/saw my neighbor&rsquo;s garage door opening.  I was excited so I went to go tell him what I had seen.  But before I could I thought I&rsquo;d better go back to were I could see them just to verify they were still there; they were gone.  I decided to tell him anyway because he saw me and asked &lsquo;why are you running&rsquo;?  I then explained what I had just seen. About 30 seconds later tow teen girls came walking down the sidewalk (east bound).  I asked them had they seen the lights and they said yes.  I asked them if they were freaked out and they said yes.  I told them my story and that I didn&rsquo;t see what happened to them.  They said the 4 lights moved together into one.  I forget what they said about where they went.I talked to my neighbor a bit about it and then came in and called 911.  They had not heard of anyone else calling in but they gave me the UFO hotline number.  I called a 206 area code number and the gentlemen asked if he could call back in about 5 minutes.  I said yep and asked him if he was busy with the same thing I just saw.  He said yes.  I then called KGW Portland TV news, and asked if they had any reports yet.  They said no but they would contact dispatch to se if anything had been reported.

It was overcast, so I didn&rsquo;t notice any stars, but there was a glowing orange object.  I had to stop and stare at it as long as I could see it, which was probably 2 or 3 minutes.  It looked to me to be kind of a disc shape, with an oblong oval shape up through the middle.  It was glowing orange.  It looked like it had a red light on top momentarily.  It didn&rsquo;t have a real crisp shape.  I&rsquo;m not sure if that was because it was glowing or what.  I was facing the West and looking up at about a 30 degree angle.

I first noticed it at 35 degrees WNW from my location.  It continued up overhead to about 85 degrees (almost directly overhead) and gradually faded out of view as it got smaller and smaller ESE at about 10 degrees above the horizon.  It took about 25 seconds to move this distance.  I did not hear a sound coming from this object so I would say that it was above the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere but not as high as the International Space Station (ISS) as I&rsquo;ve spotted that a few times on separate occasions and on one occasion I saw the station also pass almost directly overhead like this object.  I cannot be certain how high the object was but that is my impression.The object appeared to be a flame although it was different from a typical rocket in that although it remained relatively constant it had a slight flicker to it like the flickering of a candle only a more rapid flickering with more of a sustained luminescence.  The flame appeared to have an edge on the forward side and came to a point at a length of about twice its width.  I could not discern a physical object in front of the flame as I was looking for something in front thinking it was perhaps a missile or the space shuttle.  The light of the object was about half as bright as the ISS at its brightest when I had seen the ISS at about a year ago passing directly overhead.I saw only the one object and it&rsquo;s motion was continual and followed a straight path and it was moving at least twice as fast as the ISS (or perhaps the same speed but maybe half the distance?).  This object literally appeared to be rocketing across the sky.  It&rsquo;s size from my perspective was about 1/8th the size of a full moon as it passed overhead.

I can see planes around that time of night and when they have their headlights on they appear as only one light instead of two.  These were unusual in that I have never seen 4 lights (planes) that close together.  One was ahead and then two, one above the other, and then the fourth appeared to be behind the other 3.  They seemed to be moving fairly rapidly toward the airport and I figured that three of them would have to circle to await their turn to land.As I watched, the lights appeared to stop moving toward the west so I thought they had probably turned enough toward my viewpoint that their forward progress wouldn&rsquo;t be visible to me.  Then, suddenly they all four went out.  I watched for awhile longer to see if those four planes landed and I saw at least one other plane go into the landing route and then a second but they were coming from the south and were not anywhere near where I had seen those other four lights.I thought it strange that those four planes had not landed and I didn&rsquo;t see any other lights to indicate where they had gone and since my husband was asleep, I figured I&rsquo;d tell him the next day.

20100710,20100710," Topeka, KS", triangle,2 minutes,"Orange object of July 4, 2010 in Topeka, KansasOn July 4th, 2010, I witnessed a bright orange object moving west to east over Topeka, Kansas.  I observed this at approximately 9:30 pm CDT.  I live in an area where air traffic is common (near Forbes Field) where the 190th Air National Guard Refueling is located.  It is not uncommon to see Refueling aircraft fly over, as I live close to the flight path.  I know what an aircraft looks like at close range and what I saw was not an aircraft (plane or helicopter).  I first observed this object and quickly noticed it was unusual.  At first it appeared to be a meteor. I called to another family member to come see this object.  It was a bright orange and appeared to be somewhat triangular to diamond shaped.  It was hard to distinguish an exact dimension or shape because it appeared to be flying in a haze or smoke from fireworks.  Our weather that evening had been stormy/humid and there appeared to be some fog or haze in the sky.  However, the object was first vis! ible many miles away, and was clearly seen, so I am not sure why there appeared to be this &quot;haziness&quot; to the object when it was overhead.  As I stated earlier, the object was moving from due west to due east.  It flew directly overhead.  It was hard to determine its height, because I really couldn&apos;t determine its size and make a relationship guess, but it appeared to be 800-1000 feet high.  Again, because it was difficult to determine size and height, its speed is only an estimate...approximately 300-400 mph.  Again, I watch aircraft coming and going from Forbes Field (mostly shortly before landing and after take-off), and I&apos;m judging the speed of this object in relationship to those observations.  I heard no sound from the object at any time.  I observed the object for 30-40 seconds, then went to a different location and watched it continue moving east for another 15-20 seconds.  It appeared to go into a cloud bank because it disappeared quickly and somewhat unexpectedly. ! It didn&apos;t just fade away but disappeared abruptly, either int! o a cloud bank or whatever.  It did not quickly change directions...just disappeared suddenly.When I first observed it, I thought it might be a meteor.  It&apos;s speed, however, was too slow and it was relatively close to the ground.  There was no tail or anything that trailed behind.  My immediate impression was that I had seen something I couldn&apos;t explain.  I thought, because so many people were out with fireworks that evening, that I would here something about this on the local news that night or the next day.  I&apos;ve heard nothing...until out of curiousity I &quot;Googled&quot; it.  I had been thinking that all those drugs as a kid finally had taken its toll and I was seeing things..lol.

Hopefully this description will help you.If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me and I will try to better explain my observations.  Good luck.....",

We saw 2 reddish balls in the sky east of us kind of low. (were not fireworks) (maybe near McDill Airforce base)   They were just there not moving much and one finally flew off towards the northwest.  It was not close enough to see any details of the red globe.  We could not see the other light after that.  We took a picture.  It is not a real good picture since we did not have a high powered camera but there is clearly a round red ball visible.,

They proceeded to move SW from that position very slowly in a somewhat erratic pattern (not like a helicopter or plane).  They moved from the horizon to near their original position from earlier. The 2 lights hovered in the same position for another 5-10 minutes.  They would move closer together or apart from time to time.

20100710,20100711," North Attleboro, MA", fireball,about 5 minutes,"5 or 6 objects appeared low in the sky as fireballs/dome shaped objectsI had a sighting last night (Saturday, July 10, 2010) in North Attleboro, MA at approx. 10:10 PM E.S.T..  This was also witnessed by my wife and our two sons, and also my friend and his wife (and perhaps his two kids).  We first saw the objects while driving home in our cars from a fireworks event in town.  We were in two separate cars but close to each other.  We were about 1.5 miles away from where the fireworks were when we saw about 5-6 objects low in the sky.  We first saw the objects travelling down Landry Avenue, toward Kelly Boulevard (in North Attleboro), in the vicinity of the Joseph Martin Elementary school.  They appeared to be travelling north to south (or slightly northwest to southeast).  My wife first saw them, as I was driving the car.  I looked over and my initial thought was that whatever they were, it was definitely strange (particularly the brightness and the slow movement of them).  I thought it was a constellation for a split second, but then quickly realized they were too low and too bright to be a constellation.  Again, they were very low in the sky and much brighter than any night star or planet that I&rsquo;ve ever seen.(I should mention that we had a weather cold front move through earlier in the late afternoon that day with heavy rain, so there was still a heavy overcast, although the town fireworks went off as planned.  The cloud ceiling was high enough that the fireworks were visible; no issues there.  There was no rain at the time of this sighting).We proceeded to drive to my house, which was just around the corner.  My friend and his wife were heading to their house, which was some 30 minutes drive away (Northborough, MA).  As I got out of my car, 3 of the objects were almost directly overhead.  My guess is that they were several hundred feet up in the sky, to maybe a thousand feet.  They were all uniformly reddish/orangish and appeared to &quot;shimmer&quot; slightly.  They had the shape of a small dome, and they were fairly large (you didn&rsquo;t have to strain to see them).  They were definitely larger than anything in the sky and symmetrical as best I could tell.  My wife and my two boys witnessed the same thing.  I called my friend on his cell phone and asked if he saw them, and he said he had, and thought they looked really strange.  He was puzzled too.  2 of the 3 objects were very close to each other at one point, with the 3rd one straggling behind.  At one point, the 3rd one seemed to increase its velocity slightly, moving sideways, toward where the other two were.   What I thought was really unique is that they made absolutely no sound.  They kind of hovered, then moved slightly.  I watched them for only about a minute, and then they disappeared into the overcast above.I called the local police and they said they didn&rsquo;t receive any calls; same for the local newspaper, nothing.  North Attleboro is a town of about 30,000 or so, so we&rsquo;re not a rural area; others should also have seen this (particularly with fireworks having just ended and a lot of cars on the road).  Landry Avenue is a main route that took people away from the fireworks, which many people viewed at the High School, also on Landry Avenue.I also sent an email to several friends that are in my section of town to ask them if they saw anything; I haven&rsquo;t received responses back yet, as of this morning.",

The lights were moving horizontally and in a strange fashion.  The one in front would move a bit then stop as the one behind would move the same amount before stopping and the front one move again.The movement was much like that of an inch worm.  Once the lights arrived back at the place where i first seen them they stopped and just hovered untill they gradually faded away.I believe that they were nor still but moving in the direction away from earth causing the illusion of stillness and them fading out of sight.There was a family of 3 and two crossing guards which i know saw the lights along with me and my girlfriend.",

The entire crowd witnessed 3 mysterious red lights in the sky.   Prior to the fireworks beginning the lights were in a horizontal row evenly spaced apart.  As we all watched, these 3 lights moved at a very fast speed upward.  They got about a mile up in the sky (which took seconds) the first red light took off into the sky in the blink of an eye and disappeared.  The remaining 2 red lights just hovered there for about 10 minutes or so.  Meanwhile we saw 2 or 3 much smaller red, white, and blue flashing lights come across the sky.  It appeared they were trying to find out what was up there but they also just took off, not up into the sky but, to the left in seconds they were gone. After the red, white, and blue aircraft left, the red lights took off, and disappeared into thin air.  The fireworks display began and all of a sudden the 2 red lights appeared again to the right of the display.  Again they just hovered there in perfect distance apart horizontally as if they were watching the fireworks.  I tried the whole time to get this on video with my phone though the lights could not be picked up on my camera.  I do have the video of me trying, and what everyone was saying.  When the fireworks were over, the lights took off and disappeared.  This really freaked everyone out, and we would like to know what it was.

After reaching the other side of the parking lot, I looked up in the sky and noticed two red lights hovering.The lights hung in the sky silently.  They would pulsate with one another in a way that almost made you think they would have to be connected.  Because when they pulsed they also moved.  They moved in a way though that I can only describe to you as the way to opposite ends of a compass would move.  In this bending flux.After about  10-15 mins of watching these lights, they changed position once again very smoothly hovering and gliding.  It was almost like they had no gravity to govern the movement.  As when they started they were parralell to one another the light on the left then came down below the light on the right and once again they hung there just like like for what  had to be 20 more mins.  After a while they changed position again back to being paralell with one another.Then the fireworks show ended and what couldn&rsquo;t have been more than a min after they began to change color and in an instant they were bright little yellow orbs but it wasn&rsquo;t so much that they got dim or changed color but more like they got father away from us very quickly.  And just after that happened they ascended straight up into the sky gaining altitude in a way that I&rsquo;ve never seen anything in my entire life move.  There was no ascending angles or noise from engines gearing up.  They just went straight up and were gone.

My mother little sister maddie my brother dino and my friend tommy were all sitting out on lounge chairs talking and trying to find constellations in the sky.  It was about 11:35 and I noticed a whit sphere shoot out and dissappear from  what looked like the brightest star in the sky that night.  I tried pointing it out but they had all missed it but we countinued to watch the orange looking star after a bit they we stopped watching because nothing more happened.  About half an hour later when I looked at the star it appeared to be getting bigger and soon we could see it moving away from the tree line and picking up speed.  At first I pointed it out but not everyone could tell if it was moving or not but it started moving a bit faster and soon had moved a large distace over the sky and finally fell directly above us and just sat there in the sky.  It sat directly above us for about ten minutes until it stared to kind of shimmer a bit aof red beneath it and then accelerate almost straight up and turning solid red.  It did not stop util we could no longer see it at all.  We all without a doubt knew this was not a natural  as it only took about a full minute and a half to make it from the treeline untill directly above us and the just stop from such a fast pace and sit there not moving directly above.  I can tell airplanes and satelight immediately and watch the night sky quite often and it was a cloudless night.

I was out alone snowmobiling, at about 7:30 at nite, when I stopped to view some faint Northern Lights, when I was South of Fairbanks, Alaska, about 2 miles, clear sky.  I noticed  an unusual star formation of 5 shiny objects, in a perfect Pentagon pattern.  That is what caught my eyes, as there were a tremendous number of stars visible, due to the very Clear Arctic sky.  After some 2 minutes or so, I saw them all converge, at the same time, into the center of the Pentagon, at an upward angle, leaving a shiny trail behind each one, like a flash.  After several seconds, after they formed what appeared to be a single object, the single now larger object left up an upward angle into space, at an amazing speed. leaving what appeared to be a streak of light, until the object got smaller, and smaller, then eventually disappeared in some 5 seconds or so!   Amazing!  The objects appeared to be silvery shiny, and very small, for altitude,  I would guess some 15 to 30 miles!   I wish I had a digital camera!  How the objects went from a Pentagon formation, into one object was amazing, all moved at the same time, and converged at the same point, all together, then after a few seconds, the now larger silvery object, traveled out into space at about a 80 degree angle, very fast, leaving just one solid streak of light as it accelerated away.I have done a lot of work on Weather Balloon systems, Radiosonde Tracking Systems, called WBRT&apos;s, for many years, and have tracked these many times as part of my job.  I have also seen several visible rocket launches on experiments by the Univ. Of Alaska, ESSA, etc., in tracking Aurora Borealis, Northern Lights.  I had a good background of electronics, radio, and radars, etc., and Weather Observations.I have talked to Eskimos in the Arctic, at Point Barrow, Nome, Kotzebue, and Barter Island, of some of their sightings over the Arctic Ocean.  This was the first, and only time, I have ever seen anything so unusual, that I could not identify.

The light did not flash, nor were there any standard airplane colored lights (red, green, or white) associated with it. I am unable to judge the distance of the object or its actual size. In shape it appeared to be circular, perhaps because of distance.I have taken courses in astronomy and have seen many satellites and meteors over the years.

I usually see one or two during my weekend afternoons when I am usually working on my garden, but never thought of reporting it due to the fact that I don&apos;t know what it is.  But this time it was different, I saw 27-30 of this unusual craft moving overhead and the frequency of siting is increasing.I am at a close proximity to Oakland and San Francisco airport and see many planes of deferent make and sizes flying overhead.  I know what planes or helicopters looks like even at high altitude from the shape of the fuselage and wings.  This crafts exhibited no known feature of known aircrafts.I am a laboratory manager for a small Biotechnology company and have training in science.  My wife is an Executive Assistance for a high technology company.  We both now firmly believe there is crafts of unknown origin flying through our airspace.  I would like to purchase a digital video camera soon to film my experiences so that I can share or present solid evidence to other researchers in this field.

The object moved in a straight line from roughly east to west, making no sound, and traversed the entire visible sky in less than 30 seconds.  I am very familiar with all types of conventional aircraft having been a plane enthusiast for over 30 years, and this object fit no description of anything I have ever seen.   It had no marker lights and was much too large and fast to be any ordinary aircraft.  Its absolutely straight course, translucent appearance and color, and its shape and immense size would discount the possibility of it being a searchlight, reflection, or other easily explainable source.",

Again it was still broad daylight and it almost seemed to glisten in a red gold type of light..  It was not close enough to tell if it was actually metallic or if it was a light.  I decided for some strange reason to turn the flash on the camera to on..  When I did that and took a photo.  The object that was standing stationary in the sky for about 5 minutes rapidly accelerated toward the southwest..   And then accelerated again and vanished. It was a two stage acceleration, going from still to rapid speed m then suddenly accelerates again to super fast and it was gone.When looking at the photo that I took,  and after I enlarged it,  looks  like all those other photos that you would see of UFOs in the national enquirer, and I laughed to myself..To the naked eye it was more visible and did not represent any known aircraft.

As best as I can remember, this event occurred during the summer vacation after I completed the 7th or 8th grade.  It&rsquo;s hard to be exact on this point as so many years have elapsed, but I can be certain of the month, August, because that&rsquo;s when my father always took his two week vacation which we spent camping.My Aunt, my cousin, and myself were enjoying live music, a country band if I remember correctly, in an enclosed pavilion at the campground when we decided to step outside for some fresh air.  It was a very warm August evening around 20:30; the air was very heavy and thick, as most August evenings are, and I remember taking in a deep breath of the cooler outside air.  We had walked a bit from the pavilion, making small talk, and found ourselves among a stand of pine.  I had glanced up, for no particular reason, and spotted a very large, orange colored orb hovering right above.I pointed up immediately and said &lsquo;Look!&rsquo;.My cousin and Aunt both looked up and stared in amazement.  The orb was very large and seemed as big as a three-story house.  It&rsquo;s hard to say how far away it was, but I remember thinking to myself that I could almost reach up and touch it.  I think I may have actually stretched out my hand.  The orb had a very distinct glow to it, that&rsquo;s honestly, hard for me to articulate.  The best description I can come up with, and I&rsquo;ve thought about this from time to time over the years since the event, is that if you could imagine a giant pumpkin that&rsquo;s been carved very close to the rind, and then a large lit candle place within so that it appears that the surface is emanating light, rather than a direct light source&hellip;if this makes sense.The event lasted maybe 30 seconds, the object never moved, never made a sound, and then it just blinked out and was gone.I looked up at my Aunt who was still staring with her jaw gaped open, and said, &lsquo;Did you see that!?&rsquo;.My Aunt was silent, but my cousin said, &lsquo;I think it was a firework,&rsquo; as if to provide some kind of reasonable explanation.  I said in return, &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no way that was a firework, I think it was a UFO&rsquo;.We all walked back to the pavilion in silence.  We never spoke of the event after that night.There is one more detail here that I&rsquo;m not totally sure about, but when we returned the band was wrapping up, and I could swear that when we had left they were just about to take a small break, not finish for the night.  I&rsquo;ve heard of &lsquo;Missing Time&rsquo; since the event and I&rsquo;m not saying that&rsquo;s what happened.

I asked him, &quot;What is it?&quot;  He replied, &quot;I don&rsquo;t know.&quot;When I arrived at home, he was still in our yard watching it through a brake in the tree line.  We watched for about 5 seconds, and then it dipped down and to the right about an inch in a swooping motion.

It dipped and dived and moved in small circles, almost as if we were watching someone flying a kite with a light on top of it, a kite you could see 20 miles away, with no wind.  Several times we had to move a few steps left or right because it would move behind the tops of the pine trees.We called our friend Dan who lives 8 miles west of us in Trego, WI.

In looking closer they appeared to look like parachutes. Soon after that, however, we realized that assumption was impossible.  First of all, the objects were traveling at an impossibly fast speed.  Even though we were driving on the freeway, they continued to pull further and further away from us.  Another reason that these objects could not have been parachutes was because they never came close to the ground.  Eventually, it seemed that some split off the the right of the freeway towards our house, and some went to the left of the freeway toward the Van Nuys area.  After we got off the freeway, we started to go up the hill that we live on, and I continued to look for any sign of the objects.

As I reached the park, I could see that it was actually hovering at the tree line on the edge of the park.  What had initially caught my attention was that it was not moving at all.  I turned around after I passed the park to get another look, but the object was gone.  We are near Lockheed, so I thought perhaps it was an experimental craft of some sort, if they perhaps have some kind of silent craft capable of hovering in one spot.

Report Includes Two Sightings by Others On Same Day.After I was done mowing my neighbors lawn at 4:15 p.m., I went outside for a cigarette.  I decided to look up for some sky gazing, despite the sun being the only thing hanging in the sky.The sun was shining behind some maple trees, decreasing its luminosity to the point where I was no longer blinded if I looked at it.  I could see bugs and pollen flying through the air, but I also saw something else as well.  Two metallic white / silver spheres caught the sun&apos;s light.  One proceeded to move North East, and I watched it fly to the horizon.  It seemed to have a sort of darkness around it, like a haze. The sky just seemed darker around it.  The other objects, still catching the suns light, hovered for a few more seconds and just vanished.I submitted the report to MUFON.  That day, another report was submitted by a man about how he and his wife and kids saw &quot;dozens&quot; of silvery spheres in Leesburg hovering in the sky over a Costco at about 5:00 PM, an hour after me.  They watched them for about a half hour, and saw some of them glow.  Their report also states that single spheres would split and become two, and two would become one.  They were moving North.Later that week another individual submitted a report to MUFON with pictures.  The individual saw a silvery white sphere flying North.  This report took place an hour or so before me in Richmond.That is three reports of silvery / white spheres in one day, over the course of a couple hours.  This is my report.  I don&apos;t know if the submitted theirs here or not but for investigation purposes, theirs and mine are on MUFON.  I am very sorry if NUFORC is a competitor of MUFON.  I just want to this story out to as many people as possible.The next day, somewhere between 4 - 4:15 PM I went out to the pipeline behind our house for another cigarette and in curiosity I looked up to sky at the spot where I saw the objects the day before.   My curiosity was peaked even more so because of a very low flying and very slow flying Blackhawk helicopter that flew over the pipeline.  I didn&apos;t think anything would come of it but I was wrong.  This time I watched a black sphere for a minute fly under one of the only clouds in the sky.

20100713,20100713," Northport, MI", light,20 sec,"Gliding white light over Leelanau State ParkI was in Northport, MI @ Leelanau State Park.  I was camping with my girlfriend and another couple that were friends of mine. In the early hours of July 7th, just after midnight, my girlfriend and I had decided to take a walk to the lakeshore area to have a view of the stars.  We had left my friend at the campfire alone, his wife had recently retired for the night in their tent.  It had been fairly cloudy the previous night and this particular night was much clearer, so I wanted to get a good view of the stars before we were to leave the campgrounds the following afternoon.  We walked to the shoreline area and sat at a bench that overlooked Lake Michigan from a distance.  The bench looking north, over the rocks and weeds that led to the vast waters of the lake.  The sky was fairly clear and it was still night. I remember commenting to my girlfriend on how beautiful the stars were.  My girlfriend was looking for the Pleides constellation but couldn&apos;t remember exactly! what it looked like or where to find it.  As we sat there, I noticed that some clouds were moving in from the northwest and we wouldn&apos;t have much time left with the clear sky.  The clouds seemed to be moving in, fairly quickly.  I turned my head to look at the southern sky and saw a satellite moving across the atmosphere and I pointed this out to her.  I jokingly told her that for all we knew it could be a spaceship disguised as a satellite.  She didn&apos;t seem to want to go along with this joke and she repeatedly told me that it was a satellite.  I told her I was just kidding and told her it was a satellite.  At this time, I began turning my head to look back towards the lake.  My eyes quickly caught sight of a very bright white light coming in from the northwest, almost as if it came out of nowhere. Instantly I stated to her, &quot;What is that?&quot;.   We observed a very brilliant and bright white light coming in from the northwest heading in a slightly southeastly direction.  This light did not pulsate or flash, in anyway.  It was a steady light that moved briskly across the night sky, almost as if it was gliding.  Also, the light or object made no sound.  During its path of flight, it&apos;s altitude did not seem to change.  It&apos;s difficult to judge how high it was in the sky, but it appeared to be flying very low.  Perhaps a 1,000 to 2,000 feet.  It steadily glided past us.  My girlfriend attempting to tell me that it was probably just a plane, but I saw no flashing lights of a plane that I&apos;m used to seeing.  I could make no shape out behind the light.  It was so solid and bright, that if did come from an object, the light completely engulfed it.  This light continued to glide past us and over the treetops of the campgrounds, directly to the south of us.  From this vantage point we could see the back end of this moving object and the light was just as bright and brilliant from the back as it was from the front.  At this point, the object slowly disappeared into the cloud or mist cover that just hung over the treetops, and out of our sight.  As it began to fade into the low cloud&#x5C;mist cover, the white light began to fade.  I&apos;m uncertain but I thought I saw some solid form to the object, catching sight of perhaps the back end of an object, but like I said I can&apos;t be sure.  I thought I caught view a small orb like object that seemed to be attached to a larger object.  Then, it was gone.  All in all, this episode lasted about 20 seconds, from the time I first saw the object &apos;til it disappeared over the treetops. Most importantly to me, though, was that there was no sound.  This object was absolutely silent.  This object flew very low, as far as plane standards go and I&apos;m still amazed that there was no sound!   I&apos;m completely baffled by the brightness and silence of this object.  I&apos;m left with something that is absolutely mysterious to me.",

They were literally 3 stories from the ground.  They hovered around each other, in very close proximity to each other, without making a sound.  They did this for what seemed to be 1-2 minutes before accelerating to speeds of, I can&rsquo;t even make an educated guess at how extremely fast they took off toward the east.  They took off almost parallel to the earth (if that makes any since) in other words they didn&rsquo;t go straight up they left at an angle.  Their speed literally went from maybe 1-2 mph to an excess of 200 mph in 1 second. They both left at the exact same time as if they both knew it was time to go.  As they left,  they made not one sound, they were gone and I haven&rsquo;t seen them again since, although I wish I would catch another glimpse of them because they do fascinate me.

We all live next door to each other  in a very rural development at the base of Green Mountain which is known locally for UFO sightings.

The sky was clear and we were just catching one last glimpse of the fireworks being lit by the neighbors and getting ready to round up the kids and to say goodnight.  As we were watching the eastern sky we saw a round object very similar in shape to a balloon appear and it was heading in a westerly direction.  It was mostly red with a bright orange glow on the bottom third of the circle.  At first, we actually thought that it was a helium balloon that someone had lit on fire and set free.  But, ! the object was not acting like a balloon would.  It would speed up, slow down, hover for a bit, change directions slightly and then suddenly veer off.  We watched it for about three minutes over my brother&rsquo;s house and then we noticed that coming in from the south was another one exactly like the first.  This one was moving very quickly and heading right for the first one.

Needless to say we were very disturbed but frankly we weren&rsquo;t sure if we had seen a UFO or some strange balloon trick by Fourth of July pranksters.  It wasn&rsquo;t until last night when my brother was fooling around on the internet and found some reports of sights that we were sure of what we had seen.

20100713,20100713," New York City (Bronx), NY", oval,Approx. 1/2 hr.,"My husband and I didn&apos;t believe in UFO&apos;s until we actually saw one!It was a warm summer evening, around 7:30 P.M.  My husband was home and my babies were in their cribs sleeping.  I went to the bathroom window to remove my clothes off the clothesline.  I had to stand on the edge of the tub to take in my clothes, and in the far off skyline, I noticed a very large orange sun which meant it was going to be very hot the next day.  I stopped what I was doing and looked at the sky, and  admired it.  Often in the daytime, when hanging out my clothes, when it was clear out, I could actually see the top of the Empire State Bldg.  Anyway, as I looked at the skyline, I noticed blinking lights, and the object was zig zagging coming closer and closer.  It was quite far away, so it was small, and the closer it got, the more curious I became.  I went into the hallway of our apartment building and went up to the roof.  As I watched the object get closer and closer, I called out to my husband and he came up to the roof.  As the object came closer, we could see it was silver and it looked like there were lights of different colors going round and round, like the top of a police vehicles light.  I ran down and got my neighbor and she came up and we looked up in the sky.  As the object approached us, it kind of tilted and it then looked like a round shaped disk, and the sound it emitted was a swishing sound.  It cam around and went to the left of  us, and it stopped.  When it stopped, the swishing sound stopped and their was a humming sound like a motor.  I noticed windows in the center of the object, and what we thought were different colored panes, was instead, there was some sort of lights changing colors and it was rotating inside of the craft.  We noticed then two rods, on each end of the craft.  They were facing downwards.  We looked up mesmerized and we asked each other if we could figure out what it was, and we were just dumfounded.  After what seemed like 10 or 15 mins. the rods disappeared and the object which had become an oval shape took off zig zagging and wit! hin seconds it disappeared from sight.  When the object took off, the motor stopped and there was a swishing sound.  We were dumbfounded.  We went down to our apartment, my neighbor who didn&apos;t speak English, but Italian, I spoke with her as that is my language and she said she never saw anything like it.  My husband went into one room and I in another and we both drew what we saw.  We drew the identical thing.  We decided to call the Civil Aironautics Bureau, and they kept me on the phone about an hour asking me questions.  They asked me not to call the newspapers or the radio media.  We didn&apos;t call anyone else nor did we tell anyone else.  The very next day, we looked in the newspaper to see if there was any article of what we saw the evening before and there was none.  We we eventually moved away to upstate N.Y.  This was in 1963.  After living there awhile, one evening we watched T.V. and saw a program which showed a couple who claimed to be abducted on board a UFO, and they had been hypnotised and they described the object.  We could hardly believe our eyes when we saw the same object we had seen that evening in the Bronx.  We then knew we had seen something that was from outer space, a UFO.  From then on, I know in my heart that there are space vehicles of other planets.  I no longer feel those who  report UFO sightings that they are imagining or not being truthful.  Thank God my husband had been home that evening and saw what I did, for it he wasn&apos;t there, he wouldn&apos;t have believed me.  This is the truth, and even though it was a very long time ago, it is something I will never forget.  One more thing, when the object took off, it went into the direction of Orchard Beach.((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))",

I could see it immediately.  I took 200 pictures over the next 2 hours of it.  It sometimes looks like a sphere or circle and other times more of a hexagon.  On manual focus I could see it pulsating and it looks as if something in jumping around inside it.  It is colorful but so bright that it looks white.  I was able to see it&apos;s movement by extending the shutter speed.  Each time it formed a different unique pattern in the sky.  It seemed to get closer and farther away.

The lights danced and dimmed and brightened.  One bright, white, light beam seemed to be directed my way.I saw the lights change color to red but it was muted in tone, soft like, barely noticeable.  By about 10:25 it no longer showed itself.  The funny thing is the west was totally dark as if no stars in the west at all.I was quite excited to see something so unusual.  I wondered about it.  What is it?  What is it doing over our marsh?  Where did it come from?  Earlier this evening (about 8:00PM) the satellite dish had some interference and did not work.  I called the internet dish company and there was an overload of callers with the same trouble.  I called both the Wausaukee police and the Crivitz police.

After throwing the valve, I looked up at the night sky and saw an amazing array of lights moving from the southwest to the northeast over our neighbor&rsquo;s alfalfa field, approximately 400 yds away and only 100 to 200 feet off the ground.  Four things struck me at once:  this thing was HUGE, slow, low and absolutely silent.I saw six white lights in a straight horizontal line, plus there was one blinking, smaller red light above the far-right light.  At my relatively close range, I estimated the thing at two to three football fields wide.  I&rsquo;ve never seen anything flying remotely as big as this, in my life, or heard of any plane so large.  The whole array was moving very slowly, maybe 15-30 mph.  I had the feeling I was looking at the trailing edge of a huge wing, or perhaps the edge of a disc.  It moved slowly along its trajectory, headed towards town, where there is an airport.I thought:  &quot;If this is a plane coming in to land, it&rsquo;s gigantic, must be some secret government job, but why is it silent and illegally (and dangerously) low?&quot;  As it moved along,  the bulk of my barn blocked it out, so I walked rapidly to the other side of the barn, towards town, and there it was again, following its course, and I watched it disappear over the hill, with no change in the light array.Very quiet, very low, very slow, VERY large.The next day I told my brother about it, and he told his son, who happened to see the same thing, with eight witnesses, 15 minutes after I did.  My nephew only saw four white lights in horizontal array, and guessed it was two craft flying in formation, but like me, wondered why they were so low, so slow, and dead silent.  He said they seemed to meet up with another, smaller, moving, bluish-colored light, and then turned from their course and moved towards the southeast and that when they did, super-bright lights flashed for an instant, like a prism turning, and then they moved slowly out of sight.I hold ((deleted)) degrees in ((deleted--arts and sciences)), including ((deleted--multiple degrees)) from the University of ((deleted)), and a ((deleted--advanced degree from prestigious overseas university)).

We got back on the road and kept driving and immediately saw another light in the other direction (Southern Sky) that was much bigger and brighter than the first three and appeared to be hovering right over the mountains.

(About $3000.00 worth of equipment). I was not using a tripod, but hand held so I could move around to catch the fireworks.The front of my house faces straight West.  The night had a broken cloud base, more open than clouds.  At approximately 9:55 pm I noticed a reddish orange light to the South, South west from where I was standing about 2 to 3 miles away coming from the Bennington Nebraska area.  It was moving very slow to slow to be a plane and heading almost straight North.  It had no blinking lights at all. It was just above the cloud base.  I had my camera set on manual mode and was running the shutter speed between 4 and 8. I took a few pictures of the light and after zooming in on it I could see that it wasn&rsquo;t one light, but three real close together.  We have had helicopters come by and at about that distance before and we could not hear a thing when normally we could.  After watching it for about 5 minutes, I went back to the house to get my wife and show it to her.  Of course she saw it also.They continued to travel North until they were just South of my location, then took a 90 degree turn to the East for a very short distance (guessing &frac12; to 1 mile) then another 90 degree turn back to the South.  Looking at the night sky it would be like the directions of the eraser end of a new pencil.  After watching them head back South about &frac12; the distance from when I first noticed them.  It was like someone threw a light switch and the lights went out.  Gone.  Way before they would have flown out of sight.About 10 to 15 minutes later I saw them again straight in front of my house, looking West.  They looked to be about 1 to 2 miles out.  There were different times that through the camera I could see that they didn&rsquo;t stay in a group, but would spread out in a line.  If it was one object I would see a leader and then a trail, with the lens settings I was using,  However you can see the trails, but with three balls in the trail.  A leader, one in the middle and one towards the end.  I took 55 pictures of them in all.  They kept heading in a Northern direction and it looked like they would have gone just North of Blair Nebraska.  Some pictures came out pretty good, some not, due to the speed of the lens or my movement.  The entire time that they were visible was about 20 to 30 minutes.",

I have seen this phenomenon 5 times by myself over the past two months.  It does not occur every night. It always seems to be around 11:15 pm.  I called my husband and my eldest daughter to see it one other night.  The one time there was only one in the sky my daughter said she thought it was a geo satellite.  Each other time there have been only one or two of these lights in the sky.  They flash red, green, and white and are very high up in the sky.  They do not look like stars because the stars stay white and these flash the colors.  I have driven the area where I have often seen them looking for cell phone towers or RCMP communication towers and there are none in the area where they appear.  The objects are also too high in the sky to be on a tower.  They are too far apart and appeared in the NE part of the sky, SW part and the due W part of the sky.  So it can&apos;t be kids playing with balloons or anything l! ike that.  Besides balloons float upward and these stay stationary and only once have I saw one move.Tonight I saw the one very bright one and thought, it&apos;s back.  I smiled.  I noticed another one.  Then I saw a white light appear and flash very bright it appeared to be three times bigger than the stars nearby and then just disappear just near that bright one that had the flashing lights.  I called my husband.  He came out to see.  We counted eight of them in the sky in various areas.  My husband watched one move very fast and then seemingly disappear. He IS NOT a believer in UFO&apos;s.  I asked him if he thought small time Regina was so exciting that ANY government in their right mind would place 8 satellites overhead this often to observe US.  The google earth image stays daylight and had summer images in the winter time.  See I don&apos;t think we are THAT big of a priority here.  We do not have any special industries.  I just feel that we are NOT a likely target of any sort of massive government interest.  I called my mother in law and asked her to step out onto her balcony from! her place.  She did and she saw them too.  I said alright so it is now confirmed by some people other than me.  I am the only believer and both of you have seen them.  My youngest daughter and her cousin went outside to see what we were up to and they saw them too.Still in the sky at 12:39 pm.

Regina does not typically have more than two commercial passenger airplanes at the airport at one time.  WE ONLY HAVE FOUR GATES IN our AIRPORT and only two luggage conveyors.

Because of the distance no detail of the object could be seen but it was stationary and the flashing was very bright and had no distinct pattern as it flashed at random.   The object seemed to at first to be moving higher in the sky and drifting I think in what may be North direction. At this time we debated and rationalized that if it could be a Mylar helium balloon and the sun would reflect off of it as it turned creating the bright flash of lights as it turned into the sun that was starting to set in the west.   Then it got a little more interesting as it started moving ( Drifting)  at a more rapid speed in a completely different direction at first moving closer to us and the! n moving what I think was east.  It made no noise had no characteristics of an aircraft that we could define.  We do not know what it was we saw but  if it was in fact a balloon its behavior was indeed unusual and the  brightness of the flashing seemed too strong and bright to be reflective.

I hadn&rsquo;t even gotten a half mile from my house when I saw a triangular shaped craft floating slowly above tree line next to me, to the north.  It was moving in a south easterly direction.  The only thing in the are it was coming from is forest.  The direction it was going is forest and rivers.  I don&rsquo;t remember what prompted me to look in that direction but, when I saw it I pulled my vehicle over and got out.  My girlfriend was following me in her car and I attempted to flag her down so she could see it too but, she just waved at me.  I stood on the side of the road and observed the craft for about 3-4 minutes until it was out of my sight.  There was no sound being emitted from the craft.  I was racking my brain trying to figure out what it was; it wasn&rsquo;t a modern aircraft that I knew of because there is nothing I know of that can move that slow and stay in flight except helicopt! ers, but they create a lot of rotor wash and noise.  The craft had 3 lights on it, that I could see. I could only make out the shape, not the color as it was dark so all I could make out was a silhouette from the moon light.  I can only speculate on the size, I guess it was about 100m in length.When I got where I was going I told my girlfriend what I saw and asked her if she had seen it.  She hadn&rsquo;t and she thought I was just waving at her.  Her mother and friend asked me if I had any missing time. I guess that&rsquo;s a sign of abduction, who knows.  There wasn&rsquo;t any missing time. Once it was gone from my sight I got in my truck and drove off.I was in highschool at the time, now in the military.  I am totally guessing on the year.

I have pictures of a few of these crafts but not the one that I&apos;m reporting.  I was standing out in my driveway looking up at the night sky. Looking, constantly looking for something unusual.  After about 2 hours of staring at the stars, I finally decided to go back inside my home.  After I walked up to my front door, I opened the storm door and then turned around once more to look into the sky. When I fist noticed it, I wanted to freak out.  There it was an object floating in on a direct path, It didn&apos;t move side to side or volley up and down. It moved as if though it had a mission or purpose. I was nervous, and scared,  So afraid in fact that I could feel my knees buckling. I guess because I didn&apos;t know what to expect and I wanted to act non aggressive. I though that I was either going to be taken, blasted into nothing, or become part of this things menu. So I! wanted whatever or whoever was propelling this thing to know that I am not a threat. As It approached from the North sky,  It floated down into my yard just above the tree in the center of my yard. Then it lowered itself approximately 7 to 10 feet above my head and stopped for approximately 5 to 7 seconds then proceeded forward ascending above my rooftop. As it was leaving I yelled out &quot;What are You.&quot; it never made a sound, not one sound. It was an unusual color.  A low intensity pinkist to violet light, that was almost hypnotic to look at. When I first noticed it all that could be seen was the front. As it came closer I noticed that it&apos;s body was approximately 20 to 30 feet in length. The body looked as if though it was filled with fluid color. It had no wings. the body also had no real width (I mean that it appeared that nothing living could occupy that space). approximately 1 foot in width, but the front was enormous compared to the body 4 to 5 feet in width. There were! windows or slits in the front that were slanted in opposite d! irection s and were also illuminated. As it elevated higher to clear my house and the trees in the back yard its speed never accelerated. I would guess that it&apos;s speed was approximately 10 to 15 miles per hour until it was out of sight.

The fireworks are set off in a field located behind and to the left ( if you are facing the front of the school) of the local high school, and to the right of the middle school and were slated to start at 9:30 PM, but in the end were not set of until around 9:45.  My family and I decided to take seat in the field which is across the street located in front of the high school to view the evenings display.  There were many people around us.  Just to include some background info, they had already set of several &quot;test&quot; fireworks at around 9:15 PM.  Again these fireworks, when viewed from our orientation, were located behind and to the left of the high school.As we were waiting for the display to begin, at around 9:25, I was looking at the sky and noticed a red, circular object, with a kind of haze around the outside edges.  It lined up with the left corner of the high school, however much farther south than the school was, and was just floating there.  I alerted my husband and sister to the object (my son is 2 and took no interest), and it began to move in an east to west direction, but could also have been moving away in an east to south-west direction.  From our viewpoint it seemed to travel the length of the school (east to west).  It was also slowly climbing in altitude, which quickly made us realize this was not a flare.  The object also seemed to be pulsating, as in the light would grow smaller, get bigger, and grow smaller again,but was not blinking.  Once it reached about the middle of the high school, as it was climbing very slowly in altitude it began to disappear. It would flicker out, then reappear and flicker out.  It did this very slowly.  Eventually, it either shrunk and disappeared or flew so far that the light was no longer visible.  This object was visible for between one and two minutes.   I have tried to calculate the distance away and altitude just now, but find it hard to triangulate it without going back to the site and using proper tools, less I give and improper estimate.After viewing the object, we were all puzzled as to what it could be.  There were people behind us whom I know noticed it, and were confused also because I heard them saying, &quot;What in the world is that?&quot;  We did not discuss the matter with them, however.  This object was in no way a plane, helicopter, flare, or firework.  It moved too slowly to be a plane or helicopter, and was like no fire work I have ever seen.  It also did not originate from the area where the fireworks were being set off at, and it went in a direction against the wind.  I am able to remember this because the fireworks were being blown toward us to the north, and the object was moving to the west. The object seemed to just appear all the sudden, also. I would have though it was possibly a flare, being happy to arrive at a known solution; however it traveled in a direction, and lasted an amount of time uncommon for a flare.  Usually a flare will still be lit after it travels upward and begins to fall to the ground.This object at no time fell in altitude, it rose. I have seen flares before, and this was not a flare.  I am at a loss as to what this object was, and it has bothered me since.  I hope this report was of service, and if there are any further questions, feel free to contact me.",

No aviation lights blinking of any kind.  No detectable movement.  It was definitely not a helicopter, or plane.  I watched commercial planes fly by it, and sometimes under it, on their approach to LAX and Burbank airports.I mad sure not to move my position on my porch, so that I could keep the lights position in perspective against the visual landmarks I was comparing its position too.  It remained still, lined up in the same spot and  not moving. I judged this by relating it&apos;s position to a palm tree, and telephone lines in my line of view.It was hard to judge how far away it was, because I don&apos;t know how big it was.  It definitely wasn&apos;t close by.  I would guess hovering somewhere between Woodland Hills and Malibu, CA, both due west of my location.After about 30 mins I was ready to give up, having decided it simply must be a very bright viewing of Venus or something, when it suddenly (albeit slowly) started moving to the north and further away (out towards the ocean, maybe near Thousand Oaks, CA).I watched closely, and had my wife join me.  She had been checking it&apos;s location from time to time, during the half hour.  She completely agreed that it had moved significantly off the spot it had hovered, completely still in, and was moving away.I felt that it also seemed less bright, and possibly even a slightly orange hue, during its exiting the area.Eventually it was out of our view.  Too far gone.We have no explanation.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

It started fluctuating in light color and brightness as if something was just on the inside of the cloud wall.  As we approached the south side of Spring Hill it was as if a hole opened in the cloud and a bright light shined through it.  It was long and cigar shaped.  As I continued to watch I started to see two of them.  They would go in and out of the cloud as if to use it for cover.

At first it looked like a hot air balloon possibly on fire, but then it was moving too fast to be one and looked less like one the closer it got.  There was a darker center to this object.  Size wise, the object would be more comparable to the size of the moon than to any stars from our perspective on Earth and much larger than any meteor I have seen.   It was about the size that a dime looks when extending your arm fully and looking up at it.  It was closer to the ground than a plane would be flying, but higher than a bird would be flying in the sky.  The object was not at all comparable to fireworks, remote controlled airplanes, etc.  It had an orange glow emitting from it which looked almost like fire does, although I could see no flames. It moved toward the Northern sky and disappeared out of sight.  At first the glowing object was stationary but then it started moving.  The flight pattern was mostly horizontal, although it did rise straight up and go straight down twice and it moved diagonally in the sky once.  This all happened in a matter of 30 - 45 seconds if not longer I would guess.  It was much quicker than a plane would be viewed moving in the sky, although it did hesitate a few times.  There were no sounds associated with this.Witness:  I was the only witness to this at my location and did not have a camera or video recorder on me.

They were all floating in a straight, diagonal line.  Slowly, one by one the lights began to disappear until there was only one left.

After watching it for about a minute, it eventually reached down to the earth but we couldn&rsquo;t see it anymore as it was hid by the trees.  Every 5 seconds or so, a faint yellow light was seen behind the trees, as if the UFO had landed.We know it can&rsquo;t be planes or helicopters because planes do not flicker their lights on and off, they do not maintain this weird formation, and there is no runway near this location.

I was in the passenger&rsquo;s seat and my husband was driving.  I happened to look out my window to the right and in the distance, coming towards the earth diagonally; I saw what I thought to be a large, slow moving meteor coming towards the earth.  It was orange-yellowish in color and had a long tail.  As it was approaching, it split off into 3 different balls of light that seemed to be about the sizes of very large stars and they continued to have the same color.  They hovered in different parts of the sky and hovered up then down (not simultaneously) and then finally just down until we could no longer see them because of the obstruction of view and the fact that we were driving in the opposite direction.((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with this witness, and she sounded to us to be a quite serious-minded individual.

20100717,20100718," New York City (Bronx) (Yankee Stadium), NY", changing,Above Yankee Stadium,"I&apos;m back with another report only this time I&apos;m not confused.I&apos;m a Superintendant of a Residentual Building across the street from the Bronx Supreme Court and one block away from the Yankee Stadium.  My two nephiews and I were walked up to the roof to watch the amount of Yankee fans that came for the Old Timers Game.  Sure enough, as I last stated here back in July of (I think it was 1999), we witnessed them again, the first one appeared to us like fire directly above our heads it just spun around in a circular motion then just disappeared. The second seemed like a star but it was too high up to say anything about it and was moving very rappidly also not in a steady motion.The third was astonishing. It was amazing but we were not surprised due to the fact we saw them before plenty of times just spending time up on roof-tops. It was close to the Supreme Court&apos;s roof just hovering straight across in a very slow-motion.It was an oval egg-shaped like object, about the size of a full-sized van and an orange or fire like color to it with no shine or light, just creeping across the sky.What got us was that about 3 minutes to the direction it headed towards there appeared to be a crime scene.  All of a sudden a Police helicopter flying in circles around the area and about 20 Police cars.Then we saw a fourth heading towards the same direction but this one appeared to be white.   A fifth was coming behind him, this was to the left of us while the other to the right of us.  This one startled us a little because it was very close, seemed to be coming towards us at head level then it rose up at about 50 feet above our heads, this one was very clear to us.  It was definatley oval, saucer like, with two blue lights going around in circles on the top center of it.  The lights were not bright at all, perhaps they weren&apos;t lights.  It then changed shape, seemed like two legs came out the backside of it then it crumbled like liquid metal and again back to it&apos;s solid shape and headed to the same direction as the other four.Five minutes had past and the sixth appeared behind us this time above the Yankee Stadium heading straight towards our direction also at head level and slowly towards the last fives&apos; direction.  Then about two minutes later, five in a V shaped formation headed straight across the sky for about ten seconds and just vanished before our eyes, again towards the same direction as the last six before them.I stopped wrighting to the National Ufo Reporting Center because I wasn&apos;t getting any answers.  I was going through a lot of great disturbing confusion and wanted to point the finger at all the wrong places.  Instead I decided to ask, what ever I was looking at, for answers.  This is all I wanted to share for now, it makes no sence what-so-ever for me to dwell into this because the life experiences I have had lead me to believe and understand that folks all over the world will always be blinded by the truth and wouldn&apos;t believe it if these crafts were pointed out to them.  Yet a large amount of us believe and preach that there is a God but don&apos;t have enough faith to understand the huge fact that heaven is directly above our heads, in space, there are millions of angelic and demonic beings, or just normal like you and I, watching over us or just living their lives out there in different worlds.  We don&apos;t have all the answers as facts because we all need to find faith in order ! to get the answers we want or wait untill we die.  That&apos;s what makes us God&apos;s favorite creation, remember that we are a creation from above.  I searched for many answers during my first experiences and I found many answers with nobody&apos;s help.  There will be a time when they will reveil themselves to us with or without the approval of our so-called-leaders.If you believe what I am saying and search for aswers using faith from God then they have a special place for you.",

My mother and brother both wear glasses and have poor eye sight but I indicated description and the location of the light in relation to the half moon and light clouds in the sky.  They could not spot it.The light was the size and brightness of an average star you would see in the night sky only it was moving steadily in the blue sky in a westward direction towards Lake Erie.  As I was trying to show my brother where it was it gradually vanished, this could have been from cloud cover but it was clearly visible moving through other clouds near where the Moon was in the sky.  It appears that when I first saw the object, it was flying below the clouds.There was no trail like what you would see from an airplane, the object was high in the sky but appeared to be a white orb or light.  Moving at that speed and distance I would rule out that it was a high flying seagull which would have a different shape and not be as bright.

Unfortunately, we were not able to see where they finally touched down.  As they were coming down they drifted lightly, reminding us of a plastic bag drifting through the wind.  Also reminded me of those camping lamps they used to make with the netting that would burn out.

20100717,20100717," Blue Springs, MO", fireball,10 min,"4 orange flaming lights traveling south to north with 8-9 loud booms, and flashs to the north of our location.At 10:20 PM Saturday 7/17/2010, I was sitting in bed on my laptop online when I heard a loud boom outside.  Fearing someone had hit my car I looked outside to see nothing out of the ordinary, but due to the load nature of this boom I continued to scan my neighborhood.  I then looked up to see that there was a orange ball of light in the sky.  This ball looked to be like fire, but seemed to be in a half circle shape, rounded in the front and trailing off to the back side.  I immediately called my wife to come to the window and take a look, and she came to the window and watch the events with me.The orange light in the sky continued from south to north disappearing behind a few clouds before reemerging from the clouds.  After this light had reached almost the end of our vision another orange light very much same shape as the first appeared to the south tracking about the same direction.Then we heard a boom to the north of our house.  The boom was accompanied by a bright flash that seemed to emanate from ground level, and that was very bright.  This was no fireworks, it was bright white, produced shadowing effects and kind of hurt our eyes.  Then this happened again, I moved to a window I could see farther north from but did not see anything burning nor any explanation for the booms or flashes.My wife then announced to me that another one had appeared to the south same as the first two.  Prior to this one even getting close to our house we heard two more loud booms each accompanied by that same bright flash.  At one point I feared we were under some kind of attack mainly due to the intensity of the booms, and flashes, I dialed 911, as I awaited the dispatcher (placed on hold and transferred once since I called from my cell phone, made this call at 10:30 per my cell phone memory)  I saw another one enter from the south this one on a path south to north but much closer to my house.We heard a total of eight to nine loud booms, and saw a total of four bright orange lights. and witnessed 6 flashes, we were not at the window for all of the booms, got phone for one and was moving to different window for another, and the original boom that made me go to the window was approx 3 booms I had not been looking outside during.The 911 dispatcher told me they had reports of fireworks in the area, but I told him it was not a fireworks display. The light was high enough to be in clouds, and was traveling south to north at a fairly slow pace for something that high in the sky, with the flash and explosions occurring farther north then the orange light in the sky, and the flash appearing to be ground level.During the event my wife and I saw our neighbors come outside pointing into the sky at the lights, with still other neighbors looking out their windows for the origin of the booms. I do intend to talk with them tomorrow, but wanted to file this tonight as the information was fresh on my mind.Although I do not personally believe in Aliens or any such thing, I know today I was witness to something unidentified and flying.  I am not prone to events like this, having worked 10 years as a paramedic and been very scientifically grounded I realize now, that this was something very odd and I am intent to find out what was going on.",

When I was done with my cigarette I noticed that the lights did not seem to move.  At that point I looked for a point of reference to see if indeed the object was stationary.  I stood against the house and put my arm up at a 45 degree angle and held out my thumb horizontally so the tops of my neighbors oak trees were in sight just below my thumb, the object was an eighth of an inch above my thumb.  I watched it for 40 minutes and it did not move.  It looked like a string of five! stars that were very close together with the second from the left star blacked out.  The lights were so bright that they left a residual light shadow in my sight when i closed my eyes like when you look at a flash and it stays with you for a while after.  I would have watched it all night long if the cloud deck did not block the view.  They were white with a tinge of blue and the left most light seemed brighter than the rest.  The light clouds that would obscure the lights from time to time helped me to see that this was a string of lights as opposed to one bright one.  The clouds are not uniform in their thickness and it would show as they passed how one end would be brighter and the other would be dim and successively the other would get dim and then bright depending on the shape of the cloud. Imagine a 747 about six miles out at 5000 feet coming right at you with landing lights on.  We see this quite often from our front yard.  As It did not move and as the clouds were in front! of it I would have to guestimate that the thing was quite lar! ge and somewhat cigar shaped. side note....not the first ufo I have seen.",

I looked up at the sky and spotted what I thought was a shooting star.  I was very bright and falling very quickly.  It suddenly stopped and started to fade away.  As it faded away, I saw what looked like 3 red lights in a triangle formation.  Then the white lights got very bright again and looked like LED lights.  When lit fully it almost looked like an X, but curved.  It looked far away but very big, probably the size of a large plane.  It moved faster then anything that I could imagine.  I watched it go from one part of the sky to another in seconds.  It continued to fade away and I would see the red lights again and then get very bright white again.  I really can&rsquo;t stress the speed that it was traveling and the size of it.  There is no way that something that large should be able to move that fast.  After 4 minutes I decided to run in and grab my video camera.  I was able to get a! bout 45 seconds of it on film and it does show the speed that the object moved at.

Off The Ground Forming A Triangle Flash In And Out Twice &amp; Then From Afar Coyotes Howl At It For 4-5 MinutesMY UFO TESTIMONY  It was Saturday, July 17, 2010. Me, my girlfriend and her son visited the Bruneau Dunes Observatory in Idaho (between Bruneau and Mountain Home). The staff was there along with us and 20 or so other people. They did not allow us to have on any white lights and the only lights there were the small red reflector type electrically lit lights on the cement. At around 11 PM I was facing what I believe was South East towards the Education Center (look at the map I provide. I think that was the direction) and suddenly out of nowhere, above the building, three white lights with green on the outer parts of the lights flickered for 1 to 2 seconds and then they in a sense &ldquo;turned off&rdquo; like you turn off a light in a room. It just went black. It seemed that even though these lights were like 7 FT. or so above the building, they were actually coming from further away, ahead of us and were probably a lot bigger than what we saw. Keep in mind the building is 10 FT or more in height. I think! I said out loud, &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; There was a guy on the left of me who saw it too and so did my girlfriend who was on the right side of me. They both clearly confirmed what I saw. We continued to look in that same direction and only a few seconds later the three lights flickered on again for 1-2 seconds and then disappeared. Whatever it was, it did not emit any noise at all. From where I was standing, it looked as if each light was 2 ft. or so in diameter or almost double the size of the moon from where I was standing if I put my thumb up to the moon which was to the right of us almost behind us. They looked size-wise like three double-sized basketball shaped balls of light that were glowing white and green and shook a little bit. There was 1 light on top and two others on the bottom, forming a triangle shape, but I did not see any structure holding it all together. It must have been much further away from us.About a few minutes later, we suddenly started hearing a pack of coyotes a little bit from the left of the building but far ahead of us, over 150 FT or more away making some very nasty howling noises as if they were on the defense against something that upset them. They were howling (right) in the direction of where we saw the 3 lights. Their intense howlings got more intense and nasty for about 4-5 minutes or so. Keep in mind that we never heard the coyotes howl before or after they howled. This only took place after the lights emitted twice and then ended. After that, they went on the coyotes went on and on for 4-5 minutes. I asked one of the staff members who was manning one of the telescopes about it and I told him what the three of us saw. He said to me, &ldquo;What are you guys smoking?&rdquo; Still the young guy in a baseball cap who was about 6 ft. tall and around 27-32 years old saw the lights. Me, I&rsquo;m 35 and my girlfriend is 38. All three of us saw it. We, the three witnesses ! and my girlfriend&rsquo;s son were the last ones to stay at the observatory with the staff. I spoke with the person who gave the presentation in the education center earlier at 9 pm and he didn&rsquo;t act like he didn&rsquo;t believe us but from what it looked like, he had never heard of this before and was startled a bit but very calm and professional. We then went home. It is weird to call this a UFO since as it seems from what I saw it was a &quot;UO&quot; (Unidentified Object) since I nor the other witnesses saw it &quot;fly&quot; or &quot;fly away&quot;. It just blinked in and then out and then the coyote&apos;s flipped out yelling at whatever it was.Some background info you should know: Today, July 19, 2010, I contacted the Bruneau Dunes Observatory and mentioned this situation that happened on Saturday. They were very nice. Apparently this had never happened there before. I asked what was beyond the building. Two people at different times on the phone told me there was 150 FT of mowed green grass. Beyond that is a lake, which they call &ldquo;small lake&rdquo; (people fish there) which is left of &ldquo;big lake&rdquo;. Apparently both lakes combined make up half the size of a football field (300 Acres). With that info and the fact that they said that coyotes are afraid of people and would not be on the 150 ft. of grass behind the buildings, they must have been on the grounds area past the grass and on the surrounding left of &ldquo;small lake&rdquo;. I won&rsquo;t make any assumptions but if I put this info together, it seems to me that whatever this triangular light object was (at least we saw it as triangular from our view) it could have been hovering over ! the lake and it flipped out the coyotes 2 minutes after we saw it and they were yelling at this object for 3-5 minutes. I also contacted Mountain Home Air Force Base that is way on the other side of all this and spoke to them about it. The lady mentioned that they did not hear about any of this and that they do not have any dealings in that area since they are on the complete other side of it (behind where we were standing). Other info I found out is that the observatory is 20 miles south of Mountain Home and 6 miles SW of Bruneau. I believe that is what the lady at the observatory told me.MY GIRLFRIEND&rsquo;S UFO TESTIMONY  It was past 11 PM on July 17, 2010. We were at the Bruneau Dunes Observatory in Idaho. I was lying down on the circular cement seating to the right with my head up looking towards the tree next to the Bruneau Dunes Observatory Education Center. First I saw two round lights. One at the top and one below it to the left of it and it appeared that there was another light behind the branches of the tree on the right. They flickered forward and back for a second, but when they retracted it was very smooth. It looked as if they were on top of the roof but they weren&apos;t. I didn&apos;t know what they were. And then I sat up and asked my boyfriend, &quot;Did you see that?&quot; and he said to me, &quot;What was that about?&quot; and then I saw it again. I saw like three rounded white flickering lights. They were not aligned. I saw one on top and the other one was one across from the other. I said again to my boyfriend, &quot;Did you see that?&quot; and then he said, &quot;(my name), what was that?&quot; And there was a young guy ! sitting opposite from me on the circular cement seating area and he said, &quot;I saw that too. What was that about?&quot;  And then I told my son, &quot;You missed it!&quot; He was sitting in front of me on the cement seating area but was looking in the opposite direction. My boyfriend, the guy and I started talking about what we saw. My son was also with us as we were talking. I thought it was cool but weird since I didn&apos;t know where it came from. My boyfriend said, &quot;I saw three lights and they were kind of green.&quot; And then the guy who also saw it agreed with my boyfriend and said, Yeah, they were green.&quot; I said, &quot;No. The ones I saw, they were white.&quot;  As we were talking, the coyotes started to howl and they angrily started barking, like they saw something. They were on the left side of where the lights flashed. The coyotes were howling for about 4 minutes then stopped.  That was the only time we heard the coyotes that night.After the coyotes stopped howling, my boyfriend told one of the observatory staff members what we saw and then he said to my boyfriend, &quot;What are you smoking?&quot;  Then my boyfriend said to him, &quot;I&apos;m not the only one who saw it?  They saw it too.  My boyfriend pointed at me and the other guy who saw it. Then my boyfriend said to the observatory staff member, &quot;If I&apos;m smoking something, it&apos;s Parliament Ultra Lights and Wallgreens is my supplier.&quot;  The three of us and my son continued talking about it, wondering what were those lights.  We had the question the whole night: &ldquo;What was that?&quot;  And nobody could answer the question about what we saw.",

I didn&apos;t knew where to report it then.  However, I&apos;m reporting it now because I saw an article in my local newspaper today regarding a UFO sighting in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia, so I decided to search for a place to report my sighting.This is not a joke.  It was around May or June last year.  I was waiting for my girlfriend in my car at a petrol station directly opposite her house which was location opposite the Malaysia National Zoo.It was a sunny afternoon.  The time was approximately between 1300 to 1400 hours.  I was looking into the sky because I have a habit of gazing at cloud formations.It was then I noticed a golden sphere object in the air, the color was somewhat rough like sandpaper, perhaps matted. I thought I was seeing things, so just to confirm it, I got out of my car and took a good look at it again.  It was still there hovering about the clouds as though it was trying to use the sun&apos;s glare to cover it&apos;s existence.The UFO was hovering approximately 10-12 Kilometers above ground level.  I&apos;m not quite good with measurements but it&apos;s about the altitude of a flying airplane.After 2 to 3 minutes, the UFO started to gain altitude till it disappeared amongst the clouds.  Not sure if it went into space or what, but it certainly doesn&apos;t look like a mirage.I can&apos;t see any proper means of propulsion on the unidentified flying object but it was definitely spherical.  Hope this report helps out the research on UFO.  This was definitely my first sighting.None of the Characteristics check-boxes below fits the description.  The UFO is just as I described it, no lights or anything, it just seems that the gold surface of the UFO reflects the light from the sun.This is the latitude an longitude according to my search on Google Maps: 3.207056,101.755012.

And then I get a little interested in that and I look again and I see that it dipped down to where I couldn&apos;t see it.  I kept looking over to glimpse it...I thought I lost it but I kept looking anyway because I kept seeing bits of it through some bushes.About 10 sec pass until I see it again, and it&apos;s fairly low to the ground; it looks like it&apos;s moving quickly so it must be have been somewhat close.  Maybe 50-70 yards away.  So I see it again and it pops up and this time, I saw more lights on it.  Each corner of the triangle had white lights and there are more along the edge that were turning on and off in a random pattern...some would flicker, blue ones flickered, but could have been other colors too.  It was black as the night sky except for the pattern of lights on each edge of the triangle.  And I could see this by the time it swooped up from a lower position.  So it would swoop up and then it would flip or tumble and then swoop very low to the ground.  It would swoop and tumble and traverse through the air while tumbling.  Like it was a black triangle flipping end on end.3 big bright white lights would light up on the edge of it.  And they would get really bright every time it would swoop down.  It would probably be down for 3 sec at a time, then it would go up again and tumble again.  And when it would tumble, it would stay up for about 10 sec at a time just doing random things in the air, flip up over end, go through the air at the same time, looked very random.Dip back down, flatten out...looked triangle the whole time, then it would go down and the 3 white lights would swell and look like head lights.  Then would go back up and other lights would come back on.  It did this about 4 to 5 times that I saw and then I got to the overpass and called my girlfriend to tell her about it...looked behind me on the phone and saw it again.  From that point onward I didn&apos;t see it dip down again.  I took the next off ramp (W Kamm Ave), took the overpass and parked. I could still see it but by that time it looked like a normal plane in the air because of it&apos;s lights.  It traveled away, north, for about 2 minutes until it was out of sight.The most incredible thing about the sight was how close to the ground it would get.

It wasn&apos;t long, maybe just a few seconds before we both realized this very bright star seemed to be moving.  When we say bright, we mean like venus has been for the last several weeks, just really standing out in the night&apos;s sky.  So the &quot;craft&quot; (obviously can&apos;t call it a star now that it&apos;s moving), began to move upward in relation to it&apos;s neighboring stars then began to get brighter very quickly which we realized was being caused by it moving rapidly in our direction.As it approached I guessed it looked to be no more than 1 mile up, either that or it was a very large craft because as it flew over us we could distinguish individual lights on the body of the craft.  Also I could faintly see that there was a blinking of some sort, however my girlfriend got a much better view as she had run inside and got the binoculars.  She then raced to the north side of the house as it flew overhead and told me a moment later that she was able to clearly see what appeared to be a paramecium shaped craft with rythmically pulsing light from front to back.The craft continued it&apos;s North by Northeasterly course until I could no longer see it. It was extremely bright to me the whole 3 minutes that I was watching it. I have been fascinated by technology and space my whole life and am very familiar with our current abilities as humans in regards to vehicles and propulsion systems.  This craft or vehicle that my girlfriend and I both saw last night in no way compares to anything I have ever seen or heard of that humans can construct. It doesn&apos;t even compare to stretching our most advanced flying vehicles to the point of absurdity.  The reason I say that is the most shocking part of the experience for us:  The Speed of this craft, based on its apparent size, distance and luminosity had to be upwards of 5 or 6 Hundred MPH.  For all of its speed and distance covered, the craft we saw remained COMPLETELY silent.  I mean this thing didn&apos;t make a sound. Not in the distance and not when it was right above us, and it looked like it was over Sacramento 1 minute, then right above us in Nevada City the next, then on it&apos;s way over Nevada the next minute.I am completely certain this craft was not Man Made and I am not a ufo advocate, nor have I ever seen or reported anything like this in my life.",

This is one of two bull mutilation incidences in Jewell county.  The second was reported in early December 2009.  A copy of that article has also been submitted to NUFORC.TITLE:  Bull Mutilated in Burr Oak Pasture  The Jewell County Sheriff&rsquo;s Department has received a report of a bull being killed and mutilated in a pasture north of Burr Oak.  Owners of the bull are Bill and Linda Wilson, Burr Oak.  The bull was found by the Wilsons on Sunday.When the bull was found the animal&rsquo;s ears, eyes and tongue were among the body parts apparently removed.  Blood was not found around or on the carcass.  The carcass was examined by a veterinarian and a full investigation begun.  The killing may have been part of a cult related ritual, but this has not been proven.The sheriff&rsquo;s department learned two days prior to this incident in Jewell County a similar incident was reported near Colorado Springs.The Wilson&rsquo;s bull was in a gated pasture with other cows and calves but none of the animals were killed.  The pasture is located in Walnut Township, about one-half mile west of the Union Cemetery.((NUFORC Note:  We express our gratitude to the young woman in Columbus, NE, who took the time to locate, retype, and submit this report.

The first time it seemed like the light of an airplain, yet it missed the blinking white and red light of the wings and it was so much brighter. And it moved much faster but dissipated before it was out of view. It didn&apos;t have a tail or anything else a normal meteor has.Tonight I saw it again but it was completely stationary. It didn&apos;t move at all. Not even when I compaired it with the stars. When I first looked at it my eyes almost hurt of the brightness it almost looked as if it was a tiny sun of it&apos;s own but the light did not difuse.  Then I noticed that the light seemed to get a little dimmer but when I looked closer it was as if it&apos;s aura (at night the moon has a circle of light around it sometimes when there&apos;s a thin layer of clouds) was shifting it made me think of the head light of a car in the mist yet it was very short-ranged and I couldn&apos;t really make out if it was really like a moving &quot;head light&quot;.

Even though it was far away and due to the light not really clear I did have the idea it was a bit triangle shaped but it could just be rays of light.Now about half an hour later, 3:12 AM, it&apos;s gone.  I&apos;ve kind of a light head ache of looking at the bright light but I only watched it for some 5 minutes and that was almost 30 minutes ago.

It was faintly dark gray and was spinning so it looked like a rectangle building block being thrown and spinning. It spun and flew slowly for about 9, 10 seconds.  I was watching this from my balcony so I had a very clear view.  It was spinning to look as if someone had thrown a very big, very far rectangle and it was actually going very fast and I would be able to tell if I was way closer.Then all of the sudden, it stopped spinning, it was still flying for 3 seconds, then stopped flying also. Since it was sitting there just still and obvious for a couple seconds I wanted to grab my low power telescope as soon as possible. So I got my telescope and came back out.  It was still in this position. So I looked at it through my telescope, and all I saw was the same big gray rectangle but, this magnified, I could see that one corner of it (the top right corner) had a bent, broken off part. I zoomed in and out and if I zoomed out slightly, I couldn&apos;t see the broken off part. It just looked like the rectangle I saw without the telescope.  But through the telescope, as zoomed in as I could possibly get, I could see the faintest yellowish glow around the edges of the rectangle.  There were no sounds or rumbles whatsoever coming from said rectangle(s). Nor any lights.  Just dark gray.I know it had to be something far, far off in the night sky and not some kind of bag or weird toy (they&apos;re making all kinds of weird, powerful kids&apos; toys these days) because even through my telescope it was still far and fuzzy.  And I&apos;ve easily looked at Jupiter through my telescope before.After putting my telescope back down on a chair, I looked back up in the sky and it was gone... poof... just... gone. Very frustrated, I stayed on the balcony looking at the sky. The same thing came again, appearing over some nearby buildings.  But this one (or the same one?) was not spinning, just flying through the sky very slowly. I looked at this one through my telescope and saw nothing.  Not one thing!

The time was around 9:30PM - 10:00PM. We were driving to Millen Georgia on I-25 if I remember correctly around Portal when we observed what we believe to be multiple UFOs.  This wasn&apos;t the first time, I had seen a very similar thing close to that area as a child maybe 10-15 years ago.  You can see from the map on this link exactly where the sighting took place between I-16 and Millen somewhere on I-25 heading north from I-16...http://www.flashearth.com/?lat=32.554451&amp;lon=-81.86212&amp;z=10.8&amp;r=0&amp;src=msl  What was seen cannot be described any other way but very ominous, for me anyway.  I was looking straight ahead at the road through the front windshield and didn&apos;t notice anything.  I was in the middle of conversation when my mother, who was driving, said &quot;Hey, is that a UFO?&quot; jokingly.  It was directly in my line of sight however I didn&apos;t seem to see anything until she said something.  When I focused my eyes I began to see Orange/redish or more like golden colored lights in the sky.  Roughly 2 or 3, although she had been looking longer and counted 5 or 6, approximatly 300 to 600 yards high off the ground.  As I had just glanced and only witnessed 2 or 3 for no more than 5-8 seconds, they all simply faded out at the same exact time.  The odd thing is that it couldn&apos;t have been clouds covering them because they all did it simultaneously and they were approximately 2 or 3 miles from each other, spread apart throughout the sky in front of us.My mother claimed that the other ones that I had not seem did the same thing a few seconds earlier.  Then another golden light appeared maybe 2 or 3 minutes later to our front/left.  It was very high up at first and only visible for a few seconds then faded out, far too high to be a light tower.  Then this proccess repeated with no noticeable pattern of timing with only 1 golden light for about the next 10 minutes.  I do some photo minipulation and 3D work for my career so I know distances, angles, and optical illusions very well and this was no illusion.  As we got closer it began to appear lower and lower to the ground, another indication it was not a light tower. It never got under maybe 90 ft from the ground though.  The last time we saw it, it was on the left side of I-25 going north and about 1 mile to the left I believe.  It would disappear, then suddenly appear again in its quite unique golden color for about half a minute or so in different places and appeared to be completely still then it would fade out again.  It was very steady, no pulsing just faded in then out again. I later relayed this info to some family members who live in the area and they said that they had seen some very similar things at other times as well around there. Another interesting detail is that the very next night an extremely severe Lightning storm occurred in that same area. Literally the most severe Electrical Storm I have ever encountered. The thunder was loud enough to cause the entire house to tremble, and it had a sharpness to it that a .44 magnum revolver couldn&apos;t reproduce if it went off right next to your head. I&apos;ve heard that many sightings take place just before or after very severe lightning storms. One of the reasons this was so ominous to me is that I had recently had a dream of seeing a large UFO only a week earlier, which is not a common dream for me. In the dream seeing this UFO was so daunting that it terrified me and I awoke, a dream I&apos;ll not soon forget. On many occasions I have made predictions from my dreams that I discussed with people that later came true, this dream had a similar feeling so I did discuss this with my mother before the sighting took place. In the dream my mother was next to me on my left just as she was during the sighting. I reported this on another website as well, and someone had a very similar sighting with lights of the same color and character only 30-40 miles south of that location in Jesup Georgia just 2 months before.

My sister said, &quot;Is that a satellite?&quot; and upon that I look around to see what she&rsquo;s referring to, and suddenly see on her side of the car an enormous flying object that had lights all across the side I was looking at.  As I&rsquo;m trying to drive and also adjust my eyes to the very dark night sky, I start seeing that whatever it is I&rsquo;m looking at is flying at a tilt.  I assumed it was a plane with extra lights along the wings, but then as I keep looking it starts listing upwards and the lights that were on a 45 degree angle on the &quot;wings&quot; suddenly started tilting/listing up into vertical and kept rotating all the way around 180 degrees.  I didn&rsquo;t understand what I was seeing and thought that it was a plane that was crashing into the ground, but it was in such slow motion I just had to pull over.   As I pulled off onto the emergency lane, we saw what appeared to be a saucer/oval shape gigantic ship with lights all around the rim.  When it was tilted I could see that they went all around the rim.  This ship looked to me like it was the size of two football stadiums or so.  That is all I can compare it to.  It was so big and silent.The &quot;ship&quot; looked like it was dark grey or black and the lights around the rim were yellowish. Not plane lights and no green or red or flashing.  There were three distinctly brighter lights on the side I was looking at, one on the left, one in the center, and one at the right side, but there were a few smaller lights. All the lights were glowing in different capacities.  This &quot;ship&quot; seemed to be &quot;landed&quot; after it did the somersaults in slow motion, next to a very dark mountainside.There was no sound from this &quot;ship.&quot;  After a few brief moments we saw the first of five balls of light that slowly floated out from the left side (from my view looking at it) of the ship.  These lights were a silvery ball is the only way I can describe it, but we were at quite a distance from the mountain and where the ship was.  One after another these silver glowing balls came out but at different travel paths.  They were going around the base and midpoint of the mountain slowly but steadily.  The ship that I was looking at slowly had the lights around the rim go dim or something and they were not as prevalent.  The most startling thing was that the ship appeared to disappear.  I&rsquo;m not 100% certain of that as I don&rsquo;t understand how that could happen but from my vantage point it either disappeared or lowered behind land or a hill that I could not see as it was so dark in the desert that night.I was not going to go check out this situation, as my sister and I were traveling alone at night and I started to get nervous being on the side of the road with big rigs going by so I decided that we saw enough of whatever we were looking at and we went on our way to continue on to Marina del Rey, CA where I live.I have not looked into any other sightings or websites or books to see if other people have seen what I saw.  Please let me know if there are other sightings similar to this so I know I&rsquo;m not crazy or making things up that have a good explanation.  Maybe the military is doing something new?

The lights were not extremely bright but the object was clearly visible.  I said to my wife come here fast.  The best way to describe the object is oval shaped.  Smooth on top and bottom with an area in between.   On both sides the top and bottom came together and were rounded downward.The object began a slow 360 degree turn.   We could clearly make out windows, and what looked like tubes and barrels stuck to the sides of the craft in the area between windows and the top and bottom.  I guess you could describe it as plumbing.  The window were lit soft white but I could not see in.  This thing was probably three football fields across.  I remember thinking I wish I had a video camera this thing was there and right in front of us.   We could see it perfectly.  It finished it&apos;s 360 degree turn about 50 feet above the power lines and then just shot away at about a 2:00 angle and was gone.  The green way is located on SW Johnson Street between 209th Ave and Cornelius Pass rd. in Aloha Oregon. This object made no sound.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides an e-mail address which is flawed.  We would like to communicate with the source of the report.

I was looking east at about 9:45pm when I noticed what looked like a lantern with orange flames in it up in the sky.  It was slowly moving NNE.  Then I noticed that there were 3 &quot;lanterns&quot; in formation moving NNE at about 20 mph.  I thought they were part of some type of airplane until I noticed that I could see distant fireworks within the triangle formed by the 3 objects. My father&apos;s eyesight is not as good as mine and he did not see the objects clearly.  He did report seeing &quot;dim lights&quot; but nothing clearly.The objects were moving in the exact same direction and speed.  One object was in the lead and the other two were at the same altitude following.  All objects appeared to be like flames &ndash; orange and flickering. It appeared that the &quot;flames&quot; were encased in rectangles.  The objects were bigger than stars but much smaller than the moon.  I would estimate the objects to be 20 feet high by 15 feet wide, at about 500 feet altitude, approximately a half mile away.  The objects continued to move NNE until they were out of sight.  There was no sound coming from the objects.I am a 50-something homeowner and have an MBA.  I have never seen nor reported anything like this before.

This &ldquo;star&rdquo; (first being spotted WNW) began moving west at a very slow rate and becoming more orange as it furthered itself in the distance.  At roughly 11:15pm we got out of the lake and I went to see if I could still see the star, I could barely see it.  In the time it took me to walk 15 feet back to my girlfriend, I looked back in the sky and there was what looked to be a fireball in the sky.  It was NNW in the sky and roughly a 45/50 degree angle off the water, about 40 times the size as the brightest star in the sky.This fireball was incredibly bright, with a yellowish color.  We had talked about how it was weird and possibly a plane.  I looked at my girlfriend, made another statement and looked back and there was a second fireball (about 25 times the size of the brightest star in the sky).  These lights hovered in the same exact spot for about 8 minutes or so.  One began to move while the other stayed stationary. The first fireball moved directly north, then directly east and looked exactly like a plane, then began to take a square shape and continue moving east.  The second fireball remained in place for about 5 more minutes and was still in the same position when we left.I&rsquo;ve lived on Lake Erie my whole life and I have seen orange orbs that seem to be unexplainable. Objects moving far faster than a plane would move.  However I haven&rsquo;t seen anything like this before. I was blown away when I used google.com and saw others were talking about this fireball in the sky.  I hope my information has helped and I will be sure to post any further sightings I see.",
20100721,20100721," Orrville, OH", light,45 minutes,"Over the past month, an immensely bright object appears in the western sky by my house. This occurs regularly, nearly every night. It appears suspended/fixed for about 3-4 minutes at a time, then continues to move slowly, further west. I have been keeping an eye on it, trying to discredit this object as a mere, bright star or a planet (Venus perhaps).   Last night, 7/20/10, this object appeared brighter than ever.  It looks just like what an airplane&apos;s headlights would look like at night if it were coming directly at you, however, this object does not appear to move at all.  The curious thing about it is, it twinkles with a barely perceptible reddish hue. It will also dim to the point of being unnoticeable as if a dark cloud were obstructing the view. Interestingly though, there has been little to no cloud cover over the last few days.  I have tried to take video/stills with my phone but my camera does not fare well in low light conditions. But at the same ti! me, my camera cannot pick up any other star in the sky let alone a dot of light.  In conclusion, I can&apos;t discount the fact that planet Venus could be the culprit as I have little experience with astronomy.  But if you were to see how bright this object is, you would most likely say to yourself, &quot;That object is much too bright to be a planet or star.&quot;  I just want someone with experience to take a look at it and prove me wrong.((NUFORC Note:  Venus.

The stars were bright and while I was grilling, I noticed a peculiar light coming over the trees way off in the distance.  At first I noticed the light was staying consistent and not blinking, so I wanted to continue to pay attention to it.   It did not seem to be a light on the front of the object like an airplane; the light did not project in one direction like a high beam on your car either.  It seemed to be illuminating from within.  I told my Fiance and friend to pay attention to it and be quiet so we could listen for the sound of an engine. We heard nothing.  The light seemed to hover very slowly but consistently at first; so I took it to be just way off in the distance and coming directly at us.  But then it seemed to be just a mile or so above us and started &quot;curving&quot; in a different direction. It curved about 90 degrees into a different path. Once it started moving in that direction, it gained an amazing amount of speed and took off until it disappeared.  It never made a sound, even when going into &quot;hyper speed&quot;.  Coincidentally, an airplane passed over our heads within a minute of the object.  It was loud, moving in a straight line, and easily had a distinguishable front and back.The light itself seemed to be small at first.  But then it seemed like it was close to right over us, but the light stayed small. It seemed to be trying to look small.  The light was a very warm glow of orange. It seemed to me that the light was almost coming from the inside of the craft, and illuminating almost in a translucent way. It was very peculiar to say the least. I do not believe in aliens by the way.  I have seen satellites traveling over night skys before, this was not the same thing.",

I looked up and started to star gaze to pass the time when I noticed that the stars&apos; pattern flickered in and out almost like someone was moving a huge rectangle of glass across the sky.  The size of the anomaly was pretty decent, about the size of a large passenger air plane.  The weird thing about this is that there was no sound distortion in the air, so I knew it wasn&apos;t a plane or big helicopter, and there was no wind so it wasn&apos;t as if there was some strange item blowing across the sky.I watched the glass-rectangle thing start to cross the horizon, it looked almost as if it paused, then moved again in stops and starts.  I decided then to go inside to grab something to assist in viewing it better like my binoculars or video camera, but when I came out the pattern was gone.

I looked up and there was an object moving extremely fast. I live by Hill AFB and this object moved 5x faster than any F16 F18 F22 I have ever seen. This object wasn&apos;t very distinct. Once focused on the object I noticed it was slightly glowing but I only really saw it because the moon was so bright. It was traveling north to south and only through the moonlight did i notice it also had a tail. To be honest it moved just like a meteor but it was so close i could actually see the object. It was bulky in shape almost cubed and left a trail but not a light trail like a meteor it was almost like a smoke trail like a plane would leave but it disappeared very quickly. It looked more like it was just moving so fast it was displacing the atmosphere around it. I would have said it was a meteor but I saw that low flying meteor that passed through the atmosphere back in late &apos;09 and it lit up the entire! sky so I don&apos;t believe that this was the same case.

It reminded me of a sign you would see in a store to grab peoples attention.  I showed my friends to confirm what I saw and they started finding more of these objects.  There was the main one (we called it the big one) above the tree, then, we started spotting one over lower trees to the right (we called it the right one). Then, one popped up in-between those two (we called it the middle one), and eventually one showed up underneath the big one. Now, my friends claimed to see very small ones surrounding them sometimes diving, flying around or &ldquo;attacking&rdquo; the main ones.

We also saw beams of light across the sky often appearing to be blue. There was also this area that we called &ldquo;the group&rdquo; because it looked like a cluster of dim, glowing lights.I am sure these could not have been planes because we watched for hours and the objects were still in the sky around 6 o&rsquo;clock am.  Planes go over our area frequently and the lights and slow speed were just a few things to prove they weren&rsquo;t.

I have a part time job delivering the AnnArbor.com newspaper on Thursday and Sunday Mornings.  I typically start delivering my papers at around 2:00 am.  I have ~150 customers and I have a very set routine of delivering my route.  On the Morning of July 22, 2010, at exactly 2:40am (I just remembered that I called my wife when this event happened and I verified the time when I called her).  I called my wife at 2:42 am and told her about what I saw and that I was coming home because I was too freaked out to continue delivering my papers.There is a street called Louis Lane in Hamburg, MI.  It is a residential street in a generally rural area and the street is probably &frac12; to &frac34; mile long and is in the shape of a horseshoe.  The street is along the north side of the main road (Strawberry Lake Road).  Imagine breaking the horseshoe shaped street into two parts, the eastern half of the street and the western half of the street.  I always begin delivering papers on this street on the eastern portion of the horseshoe and am facing north when I pull into this street.  I pulled into a customer&rsquo;s driveway, threw the paper up by the garage, and reversed out of the driveway to continue on my way.  When I began to proceed, I saw a flash of blueish light (like lightning) along the northern horizon.  I looked out my windshield to see if a storm was maybe on its way, but it was one of the clearest nights this summer.  However, at that moment a second flash was closer and brighter and my NPR radio station cut to static for may! be 5 seconds.  This was really creepy, but I continued on my way.  At this point I was rounding the top of the Horseshoe and was facing west, I looked out my driver side window which was facing to the south and that is when I saw what really made me think about it being a &quot;U.F.O.&quot;   The object that I witnessed was about 20 degrees off of the southern horizon, just above a line of trees.  The object was less than 100&rsquo; in the air, it was glowing electric blue in color, it was approximately the size of a quarter and was definitely close, I&rsquo;d say within a &frac14; mile distance.  The object moved westward while it descended behind the trees and appeared to land.As I watched the object disappear behind the trees, I continued to drive slowly and was now facing south and was now on the western portion of Louis Lane.  I put my car in park and turned off my lights and continued to look south towards where I saw the object disappear.  I stayed for maybe a minute and witnessed some intermittent blue colored flashing coming from the direction of the object.  I called my wife at exactly 2:42 am and told her what I just saw.  I told her that I didn&rsquo;t want to finish my route at night and was going to wait until day to finish.  I was pretty scared, so I got out of the neighborhood, and drove east at 75 mph down Strawberry Lake Road, until I got into town.I stopped at the Hamburg Township Police department and seriously considered walking in to report what I saw, but I didn&rsquo;t.

((name deleted)) was in some disbelief, but he said that it was kind of strange because there was a very brief loss of electricity at the gas station at around the same time that I told him what I saw.  ((name deleted)) said that it could be the Police helicopters, because they look for people growing marijuana at night.  I expressed that I didn&rsquo;t think it was a helicopter, because the whole thing was glowing electric blue.

And it was leaving a white trail behind it, like normal planes do. It looked like a typical commercial aircraft.  But below it, there was another object.  It looked like a white spot in the sky. It had no lights at all, and it wasn&apos;t leaving any kind of trail behind it, yet it was keeping up the same exact speed as the plane.  We watched it for awhile trying to decide what we were looking at, and eventually I decided to run inside and get my camera.  By the time I got back outside, the UFO was in front of the plane quite a bit, and too difficult to locate through the lens of my camera. We never got a good shot.This reminded me of another sighting I had witnessed a week or so before.It was in the same area of the sky, and also in broad daylight.  Again, I was on the porch smoking, and a small flash in the sky caught my eye.  When I looked up, there was nothing there. I watched for awhile to see what might have caused it, and a couple seconds later I saw it again, what it looked like to me was something (that I couldn&apos;t see) was reflecting the sun.  That&apos;s all it was, a bright white reflection that lasted a few seconds.  Disappeared, Re-appeared, and then was gone. I wasn&apos;t looking through a window, or anything, so I don&apos;t know what was reflecting the sunlight, but there was very obviously something up there.A few nights after that incident, my husband and I heard a helicopter really loud outside our house, he went to see, but I stayed in front of the TV..  He explained he saw what looked like a military helicopter, because of it&apos;s green color, flying around the vicinity of our house.  The strange thing though, is that it had a search light on, and instead of searching the ground, it was searching the sky.All of these things happened just within the past 2 weeks.

I stepped outside onto my back porch at roughly 12:30am.  The sky was perfectly crystal clear and their was a 3/4 moon.  The object I saw was first thought to be a cloud.  But I thought it was very strange becaue it was so tiny compared to any other cloud I had seen.  The object was far in the distance.  I would estimate at roughly 5 or 6 miles away.  Regardless of me thinking it was strange, I still just thought it was a cloud especially considering it was greyish in color.  It stood absolutely still in the sky.  I had the moon that was about a fist&apos;s length away as a good landmark for reference.  I quickly went into my house for maybe 20 seconds to grab my binoculars which were right by the door.  I turn around and look out and the object is gone.  This is what made me decide it was not a cloud.  This fact combined with that it was not moving.  I figured a cloud doesnt just disappear in less than 20 seconds and it definitely wouldnt have moved out of sight in that time considering it didnt appear to be moving in the first place.

My wife and I were told about him by a female friend living in Chicago, who had become his acquaintance. The call lasted approximately one hour, during which time he explained his origin, how he came to this planet, his people&apos;s purpose in being here, and how he currently occupied the body of a man born on earth.During the conversation he also answered a number of my questions: about his view of our civilization, the amount of time he and those of his particular race had been on earth, the number of his people living among our population, and certain questions re: history and current events.The gentleman was astonishingly clear and logical in his expression; almost like a scientist or professor.  He also seemed almost Spock-like in his lack of emotion.Should you wish to have a more thorough report I can send in more detail the topics of our conversation.  It has been about thirteen years, but I believe I can recall a number of points he made.

PD))((ADDENDUM FROM SAME INDIVIDUAL WHO SUBMITTED REPORT))Peter, I am going to break the rules as far as filing this more detailed report of my conversation with the gentleman from Chicago.  I apologize in advance, because I know you are highly disciplined in your work...It is just that I&apos;d like to get this to you via your personal e-mail (In truth, I&apos;m a real amateur on the workings of theinternet.)As you will read, I will include the names of both the extraterrestial being, as well as the man whose body he purported to occupy (who is now, as of about a decade ago, deceased.)  I will leave it to your discretion as to whether you wish to include  that purportedly occupied person&apos;s name.Tacco and I sat down together to put in place the clear memories of what was shared.  We know that we&apos;ve lost certain things that were said - to our great regret - but what is written to you is quite accurate according to the gentleman&apos;s statements and claims.----------------------------------Recollections of A Call from an Extraterrestial Who Gave Us the Name &quot;Shimikus Etua&quot;In the summer of 1997 I received a call from a Philippine born woman in Chicago - a long time friend who once babysat for our children - with regard to an older man she had met.  The gentleman, she told us, identified himself initially as a &quot;Eugene Randall&quot; and lived in the Chicago suburbs.  She, being of an extraordinary open and pure nature, invited him to her family&apos;s residence to take more time to visit.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Randall visited our friend and her family quite regularly after the initial meeting.It was in the course of these visits that Mr. Randall told our friend that he, indeed, wasn&apos;t of this world, and identified himself  as, I believe it is called, a &quot;walk-in,&quot; by the name of Shimikus Etua.After a number of these visits by the gentleman, our friend called us to share the matter.  At the end of our phone call, I asked her if this person would mind calling me directly.  She said she thought it possible, and that he seemed quite open to share with those who could be open to him, and said she&apos;d ask him.  Several nights later, we received a call from Shimikus Etua.The following is a listing of recollections, and personal impressions I had from the phone call:1.) My first impression was that I was talking to a very serious and almost professorial individual who didn&apos;t express much emotion.  He seemed almost Spock-like.  There was no feeling of his being delusional or inconsistant.  He spoke in measured tones and answered my questions without hesitation or wasted words.2.) Shimikus (from now on &apos;S&apos;),  said that he came from a planetary system somewhere in the vicinity of what we call the North Star.  He said that he&apos;d traveled to our planet on one of a few very large &quot;mother ships.&quot;  I believe he mentioned that he&apos;d actually been born enroute to our solar system.3.) It was hard for me to believe, but he gave his age as &quot;about 3000 years old.&quot;4.) When I asked about his civilization&apos;s belief in a supreme being he immediately answered in the affirmative.  He then went on to explain that there was a time when his people were not good (I believe he even used the word &quot;evil), and that they tended to be self destructive as well as destructive to other civilizations.  However, long ago, before the journey to earth, a &quot;priest&quot; among his people began to teach a path of goodness, that, somehow had a great impact for the good.  His people went through a tremendous change, and left behind their negativity.5.) S mentioned that his people are more than a little concerned with the elements of self destruction on our planet, and wish to help us evolve as a species as they did long ago (I took this to mean, in the sense of &apos;consciousness&apos; and spirituality.)  When I asked how his people look at us, he hesitated for a moment, and then said that it is how we may look at &quot;primitive tribes&quot; in our own world.6.) He explained that those among his race who are now on the earth have come here with the help of earth people who are aware of them, and who have voluntarily offered their bodies and personae as vehicles for these aliens.  S spoke in glowing terms of Eugene Randall, who had offered himself for S.  (note: I could see that this whole matter of earth people contributing their bodies was entirely of their own free volition, and not anything like a hostile take over, ie, the 1950&apos;s horror classic, &quot;Invasion of the Body Snatchers.&quot;)  S also mentioned a Russian man, who, years ago during the Soviet period, had done what Eugene had done; the same admiration and gratitude was expressed for his courage and sacrifice.  (I don&apos;t remember the details of the Russian man&apos;s story.)7.) I asked how many of S&apos;s people were on the earth in the capacity mentioned above.  He estimated it to be about 8,000.Living in Seattle, I asked if he knew how many may be in the Puget Sound area.  He said he didn&apos;t know, and that they are not all in good contact with one another (I got the feeling that this race of people has been among us for a very long time, according to hisconversation.)   He did mention that there was a way for me to findsomeone if I wished; he explained that there is a symbol that his race uses, and went on to explain it:  It is two squares, one over the other, something similar to the Jewish star of David.  Only the squares are juxtaposed: One drawn straight up and down, and the other rotated so that the corners of the second square extend out past the middle of each of the first star&apos;s mid-lines - so you end up with an eight-pointed star shape.S told me that if I put this symbol in my car window, I may be approached and asked about where I learned the symbol...&quot;that may be one of our people&quot; he told me.8.) S expressed the serious concern of his race for our use of nuclear power, and said that even the &quot;peaceful use&quot; of nuclear reactors is very harmful to the cosmos.  Nuclear war was just a horror, as he expressed it, not just for us but for the others in our cosmos.  He said we didn&apos;t begin to understand the problems nuclear energy creates.  He also mentioned a concern for mid eastern wars, and the use of chemical weapons.  Though I didn&apos;t learn just how, S said that his people have ways to counteract the weapons we build; he mentioned their spoiling of chemical weapon stockpiles in Iran.9.) (I had some trouble getting this) The flood of Noah was mentioned: S explained that one of their larger spacecraft had lost its bearings and crashed in the arctic regions, causing a tremendous and sudden meltdown of ice, and subsequent flooding of portions of the globe (I assumed a tremendous explosion and release of energy.)  This, he said, was a contributing factor to the flood.10.) Situations of co-habitation with earth people: It was also mentioned to me that there was a history of sexual co-habitation between members of S&apos;s race and earth people.  In particular, he mentioned that there were cases of this in the Philippine Islands (modern name), and that quite a few hybrid children were born as a result.  Lineages continue to this day.  An interesting note is that S mentioned our former babysitter who he had first met, and who had called us about him, was of that hybrid lineage.11.) I asked if there are any other extraterrestial civilizations near earth at this time.  He said that there are, and that, unlike his own people, they don&apos;t all have their personal problems worked out.  While his own civilization has only the desire to help us develop in a positive direction, there are others who would use us for cruel experimentation - almost like animal labs, and even  practice self gratifying sexual abuse with our people (certain horrible abduction experiences? - my reflection).  S mentioned that his people try to drive off these evil races when possible.12.) A humorous incident:  S has a brother, he told me, named Andronicus.  He said that one day, in downtown Chicago, they were in an elevator in a high rise building, and somehow, were in their original forms...A businessman suddenly entered the elevator, looked at them in shock, and blurted out, &quot;Where did you come from?!&quot;Andronicus, who was just as shaken up, reacted with, &quot;Well, from my mother!&quot; (S did mention that if I saw him in his original form, that I may be startled, though I got the sense that it is not that far from our own earthly bodies.)13.) S visited our friend, the Philippine woman, many times in the form of Eugene Randall.  She told me in a call sometime after my call with him, that he came to her home one afternoon to help celebrate her birthday.  After a while he expressed weariness and asked if he could take a rest.  She put him on the bed that she and her husband slept in.  Soon, a group of her church friends came by to say happy birthday, and saw this &apos;unknown man&apos; on her bed.  They became outraged and spread gossip about her.  When she later told S about what had happened, he became sad and upset at the same time.  He told our friend, and I paraphrase here, &quot;How long have our people been here on this planet working to help you, and still you don&apos;t understand the meaning of friendship and trust!&quot;*Several years ago, our friend called and told us that Eugene Randall had been found dead in his apartment by a neighbor.  What of Shimikus? I have no idea, nor does she.",
20100723,20100723," West Bloomfield, MI", light,Approx 15 minutes,"Groups of bright orange/amber lights in the evening sky July 3, 2010On Saturday, July 3, my mother and I had been watching the local lake association&apos;s fireworks display from the comfort of our living room.  Our west window had a perfect view of the fireworks that were launched over the lake.  After the &quot;grand finale&quot; at about 10:40, I got up to put the dog outside one last time for the night, and went our our back door.  I looked up towards the western sky and saw several pairs of bright orange lights moving from the WSW horizon (roughly the &quot;8:00&quot; position) in a NNE direction.  The lights were each at least as bright as Venus, which was still visible in the western sky at that time.  They just immediately struck me as very odd due to the orange color -- had they been the traditional white/yellow light of airplanes, I would have just assumed it was a group of planes traveling together in some sort of formation.I immediately called out to my mother &quot;Quick, look out the west window, there are UFO&apos;s in the sky&quot; -- only half jokingly, because the lights were just so wierd.  At the very same time, my mother was calling out to me &quot;What are those lights?&quot;  They struck her as very odd, too, her comment was &quot;are we being invaded?&quot;  I went outside to get a better look.  Over the next roughly 10 minutes, there were probably a total of 8 to 9 pairs of these orange lights, traveling from the 8:00 position on the western horizon to the area of the Big Dipper constellation, which was in the northwestern sky perhaps 3/4ths of the way up from the horizon.  The lights appeared on the horizon generally about every 60 to 90 seconds, and at most times there were probably 2 sets of them visible in the sky.  It took each pair of lights perhaps one and a half to two minutes to move that distance -- they appeared to be rather slow-moving.When the lights got quite high in the sky, most of the way towards the region of the Big Dipper, the lights dimmed and then finally went out entirely and the objects were no longer visible.At perhaps 10:50, about 10 minutes after the first objects appeared, there were no more to be seen, and I thought they were gone. After about 5 minutes, another 3 or 4 pairs of objects appeared following the exact same trajectory.  The last of these disappeared and I waited another 2 or 3 minutes and went inside -- I noted it was 11:03 pm when I came inside at that point.I have no idea how high or how far away these objects were.  When the lights first appeared, I should also note that I could see at least 3 planes in the sky in the same general region of the sky as these lights.  One of the planes was very low, with a single white light and moving from SE to NW, possibly to make an approach to Oakland Pontiac International Airport about 3 or 4 miles to the nother.  The other two planes were probably commercial passenger jets -- higher up, and flashing white, red, and green lights, one traveling from the NW to the SE, the other very high and traveling almost due west to due east.The unknown orange objects may have been low enough to be at the altitudes that small private planes fly at, or, for all I know, they may have been in orbit.  I should note that it was a very clear night, and even at that late hour there was still a glow of twilight on the western horizon, so it&apos;s possible, I guess, that if these were objects in orbit the light may have been the last rays of the sunlight bouncing off the objects.  I have seen the space shuttle in the International Space Station before, and those actually move in a similar manner to these unknown objects, but on those, when I saw them, the light was a very yellow light similar to Venus, not orange.  So, still kind of odd in my opinion.I couldn&apos;t detect any noise from the objects, but as I said, I have no idea how far away from them I was, and also, it was a very noisy night, with a lot of fireworks and firecrackers still going off, and a noisy party somewhere a street or two over with rock music playing on a p.a. system and people laughging and hollering.I find it hard to believe that a lot of people would not have seen these objects.  Since it was Saturday July 3rd, a great number of people were having parties and get-togethers, and it was a perfect, warm, clear, beautiful evening, and there was a lot of activity in the area, a lot of cars on the road, and so forth.  Since over 1.2 million people live in Oakland County, Michigan, I find it really hard to believe that a lot of people wouldn&apos;t have seen these lights, and I find it even harder to believe that they wouldn&apos;t have struck others as odd, too.I truly don&apos;t have a clue what these objects may have been -- some kind of squadron of old planes or ultralites traveling to an air show?  Military planes?  Had the lights been white/yellow, I would have thought so. I did ask my brother-in-law, who was a cargo pilot in the airforce during the Vietnam era, and who still is a private pilot, and he stated that planes would only have white/yellow lights, plus the blinking red and green wing lights on larger planes, but I suppose even he could be wrong.  Satelites?  Any that I&apos;ve seen reflecting the sunlight were a more white/yellow light as well.  So, what they were, I truly don&apos;t know.  I just know I haven&apos;t seen anything that color before moving like a plane moves, and definitely not in pairs and groups.  I carefully watched the local news that night and for the next few days, checked the local papers, and looked online, because I thought this might be a newsworthy event, or at least someone might offer an explanation of these lights.  Since then, I&apos;ve done a lot of searching online, and I haven&apos;t found any references to this event.  It still baffles me because the lights were just such an odd color of orange, so unlike any aircraft I&apos;ve seen.",

It was still, pulsated orange/red (I thought it was a cellular tower at first but then I realized that HEY we are out in the country, there are only trees out that way)  It moved slowly westard, sat another few moments, moved eastward, sat a few moments, faded out, reappeared slowly 2-3 minutes later, sat about 2-3 minutes, and slowing faded out of sight.  I would be shocked if the party people did not notice it, but you never know, the wiskey runs a little freely around the 4th).  I have seen this particular orb/UFO three other times over the past 2 months with the same mannerisms.  My honest opinion about this particular episode was that it was indeed watching the fireworks display.  You can almost tell it was intrigued by the display as if a small child was peeking around his fathers legs to check out a large dog.  It is so exciting to see our alien friends coming out of the woodwork, every night is a new adventure when darkness falls on NE Ohio!",

These lights were clearly visible to all three of us using just our eyes and later confirmed with binoculars and telescope. The object almost appeared to be rotating at high speeds which could explain to alternation of lights which had no apparent pattern. This object was relatively fixed in the same portion of the night sky compared to other celestial objects. The object would move in irrative movements, suddenly going to the left and right really fast and then in circular movements. Then, it stopped moving and the green and red lights settled down.

It has a nice open space where the stars are visible with a picnic area that you can sit at.  We went out wanting to enjoy the nice weather and have a romantic ending to our night.  It was around midnight when we went, walked to the back of the pond and sat down.  We where there for aproximately 10 minutes when I looked up saw something circular blinking in the sky.The object was towards the south of us flying lower than an airplane would, and it was blinking red, green, orange, blue and yellow, something an airplane would not do.  I urged my husband to look at it, and he agreed that it was not a plane.  The object was not moving at all, as if it where hovering.  We both at the time just kind of blew it off a bit,joked about it being a UFO we lit a cigarette, and looked up and it was gone.  This is when we began to freak out and get real serious about it, realizing that we where talking about it and observing it for at least 10 minutes without it moving, and then it just disappeared.We continued to scan the sky when I noticed the same looking object to the west of us.  Appearing about 5 minutes after the other one dissapeared.  It had the same blinking colors, only the distance seemed closer, and lower than before.  We kept watching it hover in place, shift to the left and right real fast, and then at moments it would stop flashing colors and turn a yellow-orange color.  It also would get distant and then come closer.  My husband then noticed to the north another one, by this time I am really freaking out, and almost in tears because I cant believe my eyes.  My husband on the other hand excited about what he is seeing.  My husband watched the one towards the north as I watched the one to the west.  We would report back and forth to eachother what they where doing as we watched.  My UFO then shifts right then zooms left leaving a trail of light behind it then dissapears in a split second.  If i would have blinked I would have missed it! Im still not sure where it d! issapeared to.Since the UFO I was staring at had disappeared we both continued to watch my husbands, which was not moving at all.  It was just flashing red, orange, green, blue, and yellow.  I looked over in the direction where the one I was observing disappeared, and it reappeared!  They where both there in the sky again, one to the north, and one to the west.  The one that I was watching seemed as if it would get distant, and then come closer, contunuing to shift right to left and up to down.  My husbands seemed to stay in the same spot not getting closer or farther.  As we observed them seperately we would continue to report back and forth to eachother what they where doing.This all came to an end at about 2:40 p.m. when all the sudden mine turned yellow-orange, then his did too.  Then mine started blinking colors, then his did too.  Then all the sudden both of them began to get distant and higher extremely fast together(still in their seperate directions of west and north), then they both just disappeared.   We stayed until 3:00 to see if they would come back, but they didnt, so we walked to our apartment.From what we collected and witnessed, it seemed as if the two crafts where comunicating back and forth with their lights because one would blink lots of colors then turn to a yellow-orange color, then the other would do the same.   And it also seemed as if the one I was watching was on a mission, as the other one was on the lookout.   We collected this because mine was doing all the moving and his was just still.I had a very hard time getting to sleep after having experienced this.

I have met with the witness who wishes to remain anonymous due to his position as a doctor in the community.  The witness was very adamant that he saw what he described and seemed like a very level headed man.  This is a preliminary report on this sighting and there will be follow ups posted as more information becomes available to the OUFOR2.  Below is the information from the online sighting report.Date of sighting: 7/24/2010  Event time: 11:45pm  Event duration: 2 minutes  Altitude of craft: 500 to 1000 feet  Approximate size of craft: 100 to 200 feet across the flat sides ( Equilateral triangle)   (Weather conditions added by OUFOR2 after researching)  Weather conditions: Clear skies, moon lit night.State: Oregon  Country: USA  Zip Code: 97219 (Mountain Park area of Portland )   Number of witnesses to the event: 1  Shape of craft if any: Triangular  Number of craft seen: 1  FFull sighting description from witness statement:  I was walking my dog out to do his nightly business in the park near my home (Nansen Park ) and while I was waiting for him to finish up I caught sight of something out of the corner of my left eye to the west of me and turned to look.  I saw 3 whitish lights moving towards me ( to the east ) at what I thought was about 500 to 1000 feet in the air. As it drew closer I was able to make out the crafts shape as triangular in fashion. It drifted slowly over head and away to the northeast and seemed to speed up the further it got from me until it was gone. There was no sound that I could hear and my dog did not react to it at all. I would like to know what this may have been, but, due to my being a doctor I request to be kept anonymous in the public eye.Contact info withheld by request of the witness.Initial findings:  I met with the witness on 7/28/2010 in the park and asked him a barrage of the usual questions and from first impressions I found him to be a stable intelligent man without an agenda or any obvious deceptive statements.  He seemed truly perplexed and concerned about the sighting and was not making any rash statements about it being an alien craft or a craft of known origins. He seemed fairly savvy on the local ( usual ) air traffic in his neighborhood too.  He did repeat several times that &ldquo; It was like nothing I have every seen before. The OUFOR2 will be conducting further checks with the FAA at the PDX tower and also by contacting the Oregon Air National Guard at PDX as well. OUFOR2 has already checked the weather conditions for the sighting date and has confirmed that the witnesses statement and the official weather conditions match.Shown below are views of the location via map and also forensic models built to illustrate the witnesses sighting.  The witness has viewed the forensic reconstruction models and has agreed that they closely represent what he viewed that night. There has been added detail to the forensic model from information that the witness expounded upon during our interview.

At first I thought that I was picking up street lights or just a bad picture, that after a few more photos taken, and noticing there were no street lights or what not, I noticed there were two more bright nion red lights next to the moon.  My husband wasn&apos;t amused until he said &quot;let me see if I can take a steady photo for you, i&apos;m sure it&apos;s nothing.&quot;  Than he took a few photos and looked at them and said &quot; whoa, that is weird!&quot; and handed me my phone back.  There were now three objects accross from the moon and in a perfect triangle.  The objects were also in triangle shapes as well the looked similar to this {^} and had red lights at the top of the point.  In the last picture my husband took you can see that one of them looks like its in motion, it just blows our minds, as to all who have seen the pictures.It was not noticable to the naked eye, I captured along with the moon what appeared to be in the first photo a red line next to the moon, in the second photo it was two triangular lights and the moon but and if looking closely at the moon it almost looks like another moon or circular something next to it, with a third red triangle appearing.

The car was stopped at an intersection and the 2 adult occupants got out and stood in the roadway in front of the car and watched the &quot;ball &quot; for a min. or so.  Not knowing exactly what it was , the car zoomed to Lantana road and went east .The other adult passenger and child watched as the &quot;Ball &quot; also turned east and then became a &quot; Cigar, &quot; huge, at least the length of a football field, with some red fire or smoking glow.  It also had portholes.  As the car advanced in speed, the craft flew up &amp; out to the east, over the ocean until it was out of site, at a rapid speed .All 3 of the witnesses had never seen such a display and are worthy citizens.Personally, as one of the witnesses, I could not sleep that night, or for a few nights afterward and told my wife who scoffed at me about it.

I saw something streak north in the sky; I thought I was seeing a shooting star (I have only seen about 4-5 in my lifetime), but then it went behind clouds, and I could see it partially obscured by the clouds, and continue in a straight, maybe barely arcing path.There was no accompanying roar as if it was a plane or jet, and it was not as fast as a shooting star, but faster than any plane I have seen.  My roommate was in the car (passenger seat), but he did not see anything, and I kept asking him if he saw it, and he said no.  It was only one object I saw.I grew up around the space center in Clear Lake, Texas, and have seen shuttle launches in Florida when I was a kid, and my best description is if a shooting star had a bit of a trail that disappeared as soon as it was made.  It was traveling South to North, and was too bright and constant to be a star, along with being too big.  It flew just behind some clouds, continued on and then disappeared.I do not know what to make of this, but this is not the first time I have seen something weird in the sky here in Montana.  I Arrived in Bozeman December 23rd, 2009, and last Friday (July 16th) I saw a very strange object in the sky that I mistook for a star, until it moved, leading me to believe it was a plane, but then it moved in very tight curves and zig-zagged.

According to the observer, the lights were flying vertically across the sky, with one trailing the other at a distance, estimated by the witness to be between six hundred and one thousand yards, and at an angle of approximately fifty degrees above the horizon.  Suddenly, the leading light source terminated its forward motion and made a sheer vertical acceleration, vanishing into the sky.

The night sky was clear, other than the clouds in the north. It is difficult to judge the airplane&apos;s altitude, though I could see its underside in detail.  As the plane flew directly above my apartment complex, I noticed a yellow ball of light dart into a position behind the plane&apos;s tail where it began to follow the plane for about 4 seconds.The ball of light was about the size of the airplane&apos;s tail section.  The light did not seem to produce a noise, though it was difficult to know since I could only hear the sound of the plane&apos;s engines.  After it trailed the plane for a short time, the ball of light veered off in a northerly direction, and at times flew erraticly (suddenly slowing down, then speeding up). I estimate the light was traveling at least twice as fast as the plane.I continued to track the ball of light until it faded into the clouds in the north.  It was obvious to me that this ball of light was not another airplane, considering it was not displaying blinking lights, nor was it at a safe distance between the plane I was observing.

It appeared to be a star, but as we watched it for awhile, we noticed that we could both see something like spurts coming out of it and it would move. My first impression was something was shooting out of it like a projectile. It was far enough away to appear as a star but close enough to see almost tracers off of it when it moved.  As we were watching this light move around, another star looking light came floating across the sky towards the one that we were watching and continued past it without stopping or slowing. There was no erratic movement with the one going across the sky, but it did manage to cross the entire skyline and out of our sight within 2 minutes or less. I don&apos;t know how fast that would be. Now as of July 27th, 2010 there are still lights in the sky and I have noticed up to 6 or more. I have an apartment that has windows facing the other side o! f my building and I could see more of these moving objects in the sky on that side as well. It almost appears as if they are making a circle around a large part of my city, but very high up. I do live in a border town, which borders Sault Ste Marie, Michigan. I noticed one light that stood out more than the rest and it seemed to have a red that I could notice through the white. When I first noticed this light from my balcony, it seemed closer than the others and it was more centered over the international bridge on the USA side. I recently went back out to look and this red and white light seems to have now moved more to the Canadian side and more over Essar Steel which is what I believe to be the 3rd largest steel comapany in the the World. I don&apos;t know if anyone else has seen anything like this on either side of the border, but I encourage anyone in the area to take a look and see if you can notice these same lights. This is not my first time seeing the white light with r! ed shining through. I did submit a report back in September of! 2009 wh en I was about 4 to 5 hours out of town and I witnessed a sighting at a closer range that appeared to be the same type of light.

To the naked eye, it was about the size and brightness of Jupiter, slightly less.  My attention had been kept because this star had a pulsating twinkle to it, where it would twinkle white, red and green colors while keeping a white color to it.  The twinkling was rather fast, not a slow changing in colors, but pulsating.  The object was always stationary and did not move.  The first 10 minutes I looked at it with my naked eye.  I then went in the house and looked at it again for 10 more minutes with 8 X 21 binoculars, no change in size but still had the same pulsation to it.  I then went inside and spent 10 minutes looking at online star maps and satellite tracking maps on Nasa.gov, went back outside and it was gone.  I never saw how it disappeared.  I will attempt to look again in the sky tonight at the same tim! e to see if it appears again.((ADDENDUM TO REPORT FROM WITNESS))Disregard last entryFollowup on previous entry from day before.

We had stopped in Tucumcari for a family bathroom and stretching break; this had been a 2000+ mile journey and we were on day 5, the home stretch.It was still light out and the sun was preparing to set in the hour  when we left Tucumcari; the only thing unusual observed in the sky was multiple &quot;Morning Glory&quot; cloud formations that we passed under, on route 40. This in itself was unusual because &quot;Morning Glories&quot; are very rare.As it grew dark on the long stretch of road called Interstate 40, which cuts through from the boarder of the Pan Handle of Texas; straight through to Albuquerque, a 217 mile 3+ hour journey, at 9 years old you wonder if this trip is ever going to end.I can only approximate the time as being about  8:00pm when somewhere between Clines Corner, New Mexico and Tijeras, New Mexico on Interstate Route 40 an event that was observed by all 4 members of my family that we will never forget.Off in the distance a tower with anti-collision lights could be observed, it was on the left hand side of the road; it must have been a large tower because, the outline obscured in the darkness was visible from quite a ways away.But there was something peculiar about this tower, above it was what appeared to be 3 spinning flashing lights; which when viewed at a distance were not attached to the tower.My mother then asked my father:  &quot; __________  is that a Helicopter?&quot;  My father answered:  &quot;Maybe, but, My Mother:&rdquo; But What???&rdquo; ",

I thought I would find others who saw this. someone suggested this site to report what I saw.  If I thought it was going to disappear like that I would have taken a picture.Well to the right of the full moon from my perspective, maybe 20 degrees, I just noticed a very strange orange flame like light that appeared to be heading North toward the Avenues (it was to the South of me). I presumed it was odd colored forward lights to a plane flying low in the Valley.  It was odd from the start.  It was like a triangle in the center surrounded by a flaming orange with almost a tail of the same flaming orange. I stared at it for 2 minutes expecting it to eventually make sense.  But it didn&rsquo;t. It didn&rsquo;t move much really.  Never any noise.  I was expecting and listening for an engine noise that never came.Then it started to fade. I thought it was turning away, but then it faded, still visible but smaller.  Then it totally disappeared.  I thought maybe it went behind a cloud.  But there were no clouds in the sky in that area at all.In total I witnessed this for about two minutes.

They emitted red and orange light over their entire surface, almost as if the light was being reflected from their surface.  The orange and red light was hazy but it spread in every direction; similar to the same effect that takes place when one squints while looking a street light at night.  The moon was entirely full and these objects were easily detectable.  They moved very fluidly as they flew to the northeast.  They made no sound and they flew as if they were all separate entities; flying closer and farther apart.  It seemed as if they were gliding because they were almost dipping in the sky, but they also rose.  They flew very smoothly, but it seemed as if they were suspended at times and even slightly moved backward.  I yelled to both my girlfriend and her friend to look into the sky and they were immediately taken aback by the occurrence as well.  My girlfriend took a picture on her Iphone and the figures&rsquo; arrowhead formation is unmistakeable.They flew out of view to the northeast and another object of the same description emerged from the southwest.  This object, too, flowed very smoothly but seemed to have slowed down more than the other three and stay suspended for a longer period of time; about two seconds.  It was difficult to see how large the objects were because they were so far away but they were about the size of a penny on its side at arm&rsquo;s length.  After the fourth object hesitated, it followed the other three objects out of sight to the northeast. The other two witnesses and I are typically very skeptical of UFO&rsquo;s, however, there is no denying that we witnessed something incredibly bizarre. We are at the top of our classes in the colleges we attend; the University of Maine and the University of North Carolina and were sober at the time of the sighting. I understand that the Southern Delta Aquarids Meteor Shower takes place at this time, but meteors typically flash quickly, fly at the same pace in one direction and disappear.

However , I must admit that I felt slightly ridiculed as someone had written his own evaluation of what I saw on that report by  adding the following lie to it &quot; possibly Jupiter in the southern sky&quot; .  The trees where the UfO was silently floating are  30 ft away from my house!  One cannot put a planet in those trees!  The ufo was directly behind the trees, moving and changing its appearance. I saw the perfectly bright lights in detail and its pulsating lights.  Planets do not move, display lights and change appearance.  This was a moving object not  Jupiter.  I feel slightly insulted by this odd addition to my Report. It should not be there.     Best, ((END ADDENDUM))((NUFORC Note:  The witness may be correct, but we believe it is the rare UFO that hangs around for an hour and a half.  PD))",

After walking for awhile we decide to lay down and relax for a bit in a nice grassy area.  It was a nice spot with many small trees well spaced apart.  Me and her were relaxing just talking looking up into the sky when I first spotted a group of lights.  I then pointed and said to her &quot;what&apos;s that?&quot; &quot;right there...that group of lights&quot; then I jokingly told her &quot;right there it&apos;s a UFO.&quot;  Of course she didn&apos;t believe and said something a long of the lines of &quot;no it&apos;s not!,&quot; but then 30 seconds later she spotted it as well.  So then for a good five minutes we watch the group of lights trying to talk out what it might be.(boy) The pattern of the lights is best described in my opinion is that of a school of fish swimming together. It was about 10 to 12 very dim lights in the very far distance (past the cloud line) moving around together in a very fluid motion.  The overall movement was not in a straight line, but as I said like a school of fish moving in a large circle.  Very fluid, very pretty, and very graceful movements.  The lights were very hard to keep track of, and we both had to strain our eyes to see it, but what we both saw is very consistent and unmistakable.(boy) Neither of us can say that we believe that is was aliens or anything to that effect, but what we did see doesn&apos;t a line with anything we&apos;ve seen before.  It could not have been a plane, helicopter, or satellite.  It was very foreign to us, and I thought it would be best to report while the event was still fresh in our minds.(Girl)  I don&apos;t exactly know how to describe what i saw because i have never seen anything that nearly resembles it.  To me it looked as if an invisible bubble that was nearly the size of the moon was containing a small group of 12 or so fire flies.  The light didn&apos;t move like fire flies, the movement of the light was so fluid and graceful. It was so hard to see the lights at times but once you had your eye on the lights it was unmistakable what you saw.  The lights almost looked red to me but I&apos;m not sure, just like dim stars look red sometimes.  The lights moved together in random patterns, but as they moved in their sphere they as a group moved in a circular movement.  The lights didn&apos;t flash at all they were completely solid unlike a plane light or like a twinkling star.  We watched it together and discussed what we saw for about three minutes until a cloud moved in front of the lights and then it was completely out of sight.  There was no sign of the lights through the ! clouds.  We sat for about a minute and were a little confused at what we saw and decided to get up and go home and tell my boyfriends family what we had seen.(Girl) While we had been watching the lights I had mentioned that we should call someone so that they could come outside and see what we had seen but then I realized that no one would be able to see it unless they knew where to look and also the light pollution is bad and we had been lucky enough to have stopped in a slightly dense area of trees.  It was barely dark enough for the two of us to see it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD))",

My balcony faces Northeast towards Nellis Airforce Base in Las Vegas, NV, and has a clear view of the northeastern section of sky.  As I smoke, I frequently watch planes landing or taking off from Mcarren Airport, or I watch aircraft fly to and from Nellis.  On August 27th around 3 p.m. I was on my balcony, and I noticed right away that a plane was approaching Las Vegas from the North. Whats interesting about that is Ive learned through months of everyday observing that planes do not fly in from the North, so I picked up my binoculars (used for watching the planes and helicopters fly from Nellis) and saw that it was one of those &quot;Janet&quot; planes that transport employees to and from Area 51 (Classic red stripe passenger plane with no identifiable markings). As I followed the plane with my binoculars, I then noticed something appear in my field of vision that was further away beyond the! Janet plane. I stopped and adjusted my binocs to get a clearer image of what this object was, and once I did I could see a white, solid, dome shaped object hovering in place far off in the distance. I know distances can be deceiving, so I dont want to say how far away i think it was exactly, but I can say it was miles, beyond Sunrise mountain and perhaps even Lake Mead. I stood and watched it for 2-3 minutes until I noticed another Janet plan coming into approach at McCarran. I took my eyes off the craft for only a second and when I scanned the area it had been, it was gone! I searched the entire sky for about 20 minutes and never saw it again. It was dome shaped, white and never moved from the spot I first saw it. I assume that it was far away, and if it was then I would say the craft was huge. Being stationary, I was able to study it for 2-3 minutes through my binoculars and though it was too far to make out any details, I can say it was big enough to clearly make out it! s shape.

Way too far away, in my opinion, that&apos;s around 50-60 or greater miles away.  If it were a flare, from a boat on Lake George, once again, I&apos;d have ruled it out.There were visible aircraft in the Area, with green and red lights, blinking. They were obvious commercial Aircraft.I called my friend, explained what was going on, while watching it. That was 3 minutes in. He works at a Government facility near Jacksonville and asked if he was busy with anything that night, I&apos;ll keep that interpretation up to you. There is a Power Station North of the site, and I thought well maybe it is some kind of reflection. He said no.  He will talk to me in person soon about this, But because of the sensitivity of his job, I&apos;m not sure if he will.  He&apos;s a close friend though.As for myself, That&apos;s where I was, that&apos;s what I saw. My  Anonymousness is no matter,  My Personal description is one of a College Educated Young man.

These clouds are located in the southern sky from my vantage point and will move both horizontally and vertically at will.  There does not seem to be any particular pattern to them.

I noticed two bright white disk-shaped objects, very close together, very distinctive as opaque objects, with a thin dark grey edge, meandering through the sky, sort of slowly circling each other but together moving swiftly southward down the valley.  They seemed about 2 miles up. No trails or glow, just two waferlike disc objects, not natural, not spherical.  These were definitely manufactured objects. They were not birds or balloons that is for sure.The edges of the two disks were crisp and defined, and there was no reflection, like it had a white matte finish.  No markings that I could see.  When I first looked I thought it could be two aircraft. But then I focused and realized these were round and the way they behaved together, sort of a figure 8 motion to each other as they moved collectively and rapidly through the air heading down the valley, I have never seen that before with aircraft.What were they?",

Upon looking at it closer I noticed that the light formation on it was different than the airplanes that I&rsquo;m so used to seeing. What caught my attention was that it was moving abnormally slow for an airplane, but on par with maybe a helicopter or blimp. For a minute, I thought it could be an ultra light aircraft, but it was completely silent.  Next I thought maybe the lights on the bottom of a blimp, but I have never witnessed a blimp in 15 years of living here.  My best guess was that it was triangle shaped, but it was very hard to make out with city lights around. This thing whatever it was made absolutely no noise.  It kept slowing down and finally stopped and sat there for about 10 seconds before changing course.  It was initially heading west but stopped and changed course to heading due north. When it changed direction it went straight over head.  As it flew over I tried to make out what it was.  It had three white lights in a triangle formation with one blinking red light in the middle with one additional slightly dimmer blinking white light mixed in.   The red light was slightly brighter than the rest of the lights. It didn&rsquo;t seem to be very far up at all, and it wasn&rsquo;t very big that I could tell.  Before it changed course, it was sort of near the moon I could make out sort of a roundish looking bottom to it, but only for a second. As it moved northward, it picked up speed to what would be expected of an airplane.  I ran into the house to get my video camera, but when I came out it was way far off.I am quite used to planes flying over and see them often.  I don&rsquo;t however EVER see a plane slow down, stop, and then completely change course.   It was very eerie watching that fly overhead with no noise at all!  The blinking red light seemed to indicate that it was manmade, but who knows?   Whatever it was it gave me the creeps!  I&rsquo;m a student here, and have good eyesight and wasn&rsquo;t at all drunk or anything.  This was not the first weird thing I&rsquo;ve seen here either.  On Dec, 23 and 24 of 2009, I saw a ball of light out in the distance that looked like the spot light on the front of a helicopter, but got dimmer and after it travelled some distance faded into nothing.  I saw this twice in two days!  I followed the second one for a block or so on foot just watching before it finally blinked out.  I highly doubt it was &quot;Chinese lanterns&quot; as some might say.

As is my habit, when I got out of the car I looked up and surveyed the nighttime sky. Looking in a south-easterly direction I noticed what looked to be an airplane. Again, as is my habit, I looked for the FAA lights (blinking red and green lights). I did not see any.  The light was pretty bright, so it&apos;s possible that, due to the angle and the brightness of the light, I just couldn&apos;t see them. I also noticed the speed, which seemed relatively normal for an airplane.  The trajectory was mostly straight, though for a moment I could have sworn that I saw it drift to the east just a bit. This could have been an optical illusion.  However, over the course of the 20 or so seconds that I was watching, I saw the light increase in brilliance.  The object seemed to get bigger, though this might have been an effect of the increasing luminosity, changing from an off-w! hite color to more of a resplendent white. This lasted about 5 seconds, after which the light dimmed, making the object seem as if it were getting smaller. As it dimmed it became blue, like so many stars.  What was left, for a moment, was a dim dot of light surrounded by an even fainter corona; it resembled the dot of light that would be left in the center of the screen on old black-and-white televisions immediately after being turned off.  This lasted for just a moment, after which the dot became smaller and dimmer, until disappearing altogether. I kept looking at the sky for at least another ten minutes, in case it was an airplane that had turned it&apos;s lights off momentarily, but the light did not reappear.

As I continued to investigate, it slowly -- and at a deliberate and even pace - traversed east across the moon.I got the sense I was witnessing something quite unique and even though it sounds mundane as I type this, it was truly awesome as it stretched as far north and south as the eye could see.  It was geometrically perfect, narrowing at both ends.  If I had to guess at what it might be, I could only say that I believe it was a deliberate mass of something that had a specific purpose.As it arrived close to the moon and was about to cross it, I could determine it was approximately twice as wide as the moon, and as it traveled east and away from the moon, it got dimmer until I could no longer make out the outline.NOTE: I am a frequent sky watcher, C2C listener and have observed (and filmed) many unexplained phenomena and I have never seen anything like this before.",

I was a fence line detail and paused for a few minutes to stretch my legs and was watching the flight corridor to SEATAC.  I noticed an airliner coming into view and then noticed a very fast approaching aircraft approaching the corridor from the southeast at about the same altitude.   I at first thought it could have been a private jet just coming into the corridor to line up for approach to SEATAC.  As this situation progressed I figured the fast approaching aircraft would bleed off speed and fall in line. But as I watched I noticed no active beacon or navs and thought it a little weird that this thing would already have his approach lights on.  The craft entered the corridor and at this point continuing his northwest heading at a very high rate of speed and what appeared to be the same altitude and as the situation progressed appeared to be on a collision course with the airli! ner.  As I was watching a pit began to grow in my stomach thinking &ldquo;oh no this might be a bad deal.&rdquo;   The craft continued its heading and it appeared they were going to make physical contact.  The craft narrowly missed the airliner&rsquo;s tail section (I am estimating because of regulation altitude per FAA standards) was about a 1/8th of a mile.  The thought crossed my mind that this may be an intercept mission by the Air Force and was engaging the airliner.  The craft then banked hard left, same rate of speed coming along side then accelerated banking hard left again this time at an impossible angle of attack cutting in front of the airliner then moved to left wing of the airliner then came to an absolute dead stop off the left wing of the airliner.  I watched in amazement as the airliner continued its flight path all the while keeping my eyes locked on the other craft.  Once the airliner was past the other craft dimmed itself to match surrounding stars.  I stood for another 20 minut! es transfixed on the craft. I then began to notice other airli! ners div erting in a northwest arc the first aircraft coming on the scene banking hard right as I believe enroute control diverted them because of the situation.  As this aircraft diverted I tried to keep an eye on the stationary craft.  I waited about 2 minutes then turned to see the location of the airliner which by my estimate was at about the same northwest vector as when the craft  approached the first airliner at.  I then turned to look and the craft lit back up and accelerated at a blinding speed to intercept the diverted airliner.

Then we figured that it was a tower of some sort, but there were no lights above it or below it like on the legs of a microwave or water tower.We kept watching the object for about 12-15 minutes until we finally got right up to it, at Exit 143.  The object was almost directly above the interstate, just to the south side and maybe 300-500 feet up.  I slowed the car down to a crawl and rolled the window down and miraculously we weren&rsquo;t rear-ended by the cars behind us.  I could hear no engine sounds and felt/heard no propeller wash, as from a helicopter.  From underneath the object we saw three large circular red lights in a line and perpendicular to that line was a curved line of red lights.  In between the red lights there were smaller circular lights which I believe were white in color.  At the eastern end of the object (the side we approached from, which I believe to be the front of the object) we saw what appeared to be to spot lights pointed east and angled slightly toward the ground.After we passed by the object I immediately called my father (an Air Force vet who grew up on US Marine bases) and asked him if he knew of anything that could fit the description.  Dad could not tell me about anything that fit that description.  My wife and I quickly sped up and turned around at the first opportunity (Exit 137) to try to get a picture of it.  The object was out of our sight for two to three minutes while we turned around.  When we got back to the place where we passed beneath the object, it was gone without a trace.I am pretty familiar with military and civilian aircraft, fixed and rotary wing alike, having grown up in a military family and around air bases/air ports.  I haven&rsquo;t the faintest clue what this object was, where it came from, or where it went.  Any suggestions?",

This continued with three other distinct signlas such as a ship sending morse code.

It appeared to us that the blinking was deliberate and not due to atmospheric conditions (stars twinkling) it appeared to us as a flashlight at some distance turning on and off.",

There is a new Spencer in service, but this is not the one I was aboard.  My ship was a 327 ft Cutter.  It can be viewed if you google Coast Guard Cutter Spencer WHEC-36.  I have tried to the best of my ability to recall the date, but since we stood so many Ocean Stations, it is hard to remember which of those this occured.  The conditions were warm, seas calm, and sighting occured during the night.  There were 140 mean aboard the Spencer, and a large number of my fellow crewmen witnessed what I did.  Officers and enlisted men saw what I saw.  I remember a ((specialty deleted)) had some state-of-the-art photo equipment.  I think he had an Olympus camera with telephoto lens.  He was at least one crewmen photographing this UFO.  We were in the middile of the Atlantic, all running ligh! ts on as usual.  I remember someone saying come on deck, there&apos;s a UFO.  The UFO had bright lights that changed color.  It was if the UFO was checking us out.  A ship with all its running lights on would be easily seen from above in the Atantic.

I can&apos;t be sure they were aboard for this Duty, but I&apos;m sure at least one was.  I can not remember the others.  The UFO would come down hovering above us.  We could see what I would describe as portholes.  I rotated as it hovered.  The lights changed color.  Then it would go up in a second becoming very small.  Then it seemed to show off, as if it knew we were watching it.  It would accelerate across the sky in a split second while doing right angles.  Many photos of this craft were taken with telephoto lens.  I remember I couldn&apos;t wait to see the photos after they were developed.  I never saw them.  The show lasted about an hour.  Messages of this sighting were sent to Washington, DC.!  When we were relieved from Ocean Station Duty, we headed back to Governor&apos;s Island, Yankee Pier, where was our home port.  We were not expecting the reception that we received.  As we were docking, I saw quite a few &quot;Men In Black&quot; waiting to board our ship.  Usually after docking, if you did not have duty, we were granted liberty of usually 72 hours.  No one was allowed to leave the ship.  We were all interrogated one by one by these &quot;Men In Black&quot;.  We were told to sign an affidavit, stating we saw nothing.  We were warned that if we mention this to anyone, we would be gone.  We were told not to go to any news media, and try and tell this story.  If we did, we would be prosecuted by the govenment.  I found out later that my friend, the ((specialty deleted)) had all of his photo equipment, pictures, and developing equipment confiscated.  He was not reimbursed for any of his expensive equipment, it was simply taken from him.  I will end the story here, to be brief as possible.

The reason I am writing to you is that I have never heard of the type of sighting that I had.  I was in the back yard with a friend watching the stars when I saw something out of my peripheral vision.  I turned to see a rose colored rectangle shaped fog or cloud comming towards us.  We stood completely still.  There was no sound, it stopped right above our heads and stayed there for 20 seconds or so.  The object was not visible to us, just a fog, the only thing I can relate to would be what Star Trek called cloaking.   The fog object was rectangle in shape, rose pink in color.  We watched it as it went over the ocean towards the Channel Islands which are about 20 miles from my home.  The craft flew over the ocean toward the islands and disappeared within 10 seconds. Have you ever heard of a sighting like this?  I have listened to Art Bell since he hosted Dreamland and never heard any discription of a sighting like mine.  I know when the object was above us that they saw us and were observing us.  I don&apos;t know how far above our heads it was, but if I took a guess it would be 75 to 100 feet.

20100731,20100731," Oregon House, CA", light,5 minutes,"Four lights at dusk that appear then dissaappearI was sitting outside with a friend having dinner in his garden.  I was sitting at a table between two modular homes. I was facing approximately, North, North-East.  At the time of the siting, I looked up about 45 degrees and saw a light in the sky.  Then there was a second light to the left of the first one. I first thought there these were early stars, but the sky was still quite blue, the star Antaries, which usually came out first, directly above, was not out yet.My first thought was that I was seeing an aircraft, or a satellite, or a space station.  I commented to my friend about seeing two lights.  Then the one to the left started to move to the left.  As it did, two other lights appeared about these first two.  They were closer together than the firs two.  Then the second light that moved to the left disappeared.  Thie direction would be toward the North West. Now there was just the three.  Then the upper two lights disappeared followed by the first light.I was puzzled because, these lights really looked like faint stars, but it was too early for stars to appear. The final formation of these four points of light could be labeled like the geometric figure known as a trapezoid.  The lower left point of light was the one that moved away. I tried to see if the other three moved in any direction. They did not. They only disappeared.Thirty minutes later when the Great Dipper came out I tried to get my bearings to determine which part of the sky these lights appeared. This was approximately above the constellation of Cassiopeia.  But not as high as the North Star.This siting was so unusual that I got up from the dinner table and started mentioning to my friend that there were some lights in the sky and that one was moving. It was shortly after standing up that the other two higher lights appeared and then disappeared. My friend also got up from the table.  I pointed to the area of the sky where I was seeing the lights.  I asked him if he saw the lights, but he said he did not see any lights.Usually I wear contact lenses in both eyes.  For over a month I have not worn a contact lens in my left eye, in order to prepare for an eye test, prior to cataract surgery.  I was only wearing one contact lens in my right eye.   My vision in my right eye, with corrective lens is better than normal.  It is between 20/50 and 20/70.   I am very certain that I say what I saw.  Also, I have an uncanny suspicion, that these lights were part of the same phenomenon.",
20100731,20100731," Peoria, IL", disk,3 minutes,"Two people see UFO hovering at a distance of 10 feet.I heard Peter Davenport on the 07-29-10 episode of Coast to Coast AM and decided to submit my story.Headline: UFO at a stone&apos;s throw  This story takes place in 1992 in Illinois.My friend and I were parked facing north at night in the summer on a small concrete bridge over a small creek in rural Illinois.  We were not quite ready to go home and wanted to continue our conversation about &quot;girlfriends.&quot;  The weather was cloudy and misty.  We could see sheet lighting in the distance.  My car windows had droplets of water on them.  I sat in the driver&apos;s seat, my friend sat in the passenger&apos;s seat of my Ford Escort.The creek bridge had cement guardrails that were almost perfectly level with where the car windows started.  I suspect this was a purposeful choice by the architect. The road continued on north to a T-section about 1/4 down the road.  Beyond that intersection was a large hill that spanned for miles in each direction.  Approach to the creek bridge was as if going down a slight hill, and the incline continued on for awhile and then began sloping up again toward the T-section.  We were of a slightly higher altitude than the cornfields directly to the left and right front of us that bordered the creek.  The border of the creek was a slight hill that blocked view of the field beyond to our right (2 o&apos;clock).  Over our right shoulders at about 4 o&apos;clock (direction), was four-story tall mound/hill left over from an old gravel pit that had trees and brush all over it.  This mound followed the other creek border for about a half a mile to the east.So from our perspective, we could not see the field to our right front, nor see beyond over the hill over our right shoulders.  The creek was essentially bordered on both sides with land that stretched out as far as the eye could see.  It was here that we watched the lighting in the distance.   I could see the lightening from tens of miles away over the top of the distant hills, but there was additional light coming from closer up.  At first I just dismissed it as ball lighting, but I could see the light illuminating the mist just above the hill.  I could not see into the field where the light seemed to be coming from, just the effects of the light on the trees on the border of the creek.  I stopped my friend from talking and said, &quot;Friend, why is that lightening going on and off with a beat.  Nature is not that exact.&quot;  I began snapping my fingers to the rate of the light from the field going on and off.  On, snap, off, snap.  It was a perfect beat (I am a musician).  I tol! d my friend to roll down his window and just as the window rolled down, a craft popped out from behind the hill.  It was level with us, and we were approximately at most 10 ft from the craft.  I could have easily jumped on top of the craft from the side of the bridge without straining myself.I was speechless.  At the time I was morally opposed to the idea of alien spacecraft.  My family were strict Christians who specifically were taught at our denomination that humans on Earth were the only organic life in the universe.  I was 100% against the ideas of aliens existing.  Yet, here before me and my friend was this totally silent craft, about the size of a large SUV, hovering, silently.I broke the silence by startling loudly, &quot;THAT IS NOT A UFO!&quot;  At the time that I said that, the craft was just a little past us.  The craft was almost directly to our right, but a little farther past us at that point.  It abruptly changed course (as if it heard me) and either turned off its lights, put on a cloaking device or did something else because it seemed to just go right into the opposite hill, but more likely it just went &quot;dark.&quot;  I revved up my engine and drove away very fast.  My perspective on everything had just come crashing down in one fell swoop of time no more than 3 minutes long.I got to my house, where my friend&apos;s car was, and he asked me to follow him back home (because he was too freaked out to go over that bridge alone).  So I followed him home.  By the time I got back to the bridge, my fear had gone down, and I was filled with wonder.  The storm had passed, so I parked on the bridge again alone, turned on a Cure CD and sat Indian style on the roof of my car, searching the landscape and the sky for anything out of the ordinary.Nothing.  Silence.Oddly, it was from that moment on that I started to experience the phenomenon known as &quot;synchronicity.&quot;  As I drove back to my house that night, I though, &quot;what if when I get home my family has been abducted!&quot;  I got home and went to my parent&apos;s bedroom and listened for breathing.  Nothing, so I turned on the light and the bed was empty and made, at like 2 a.m.!  I ran to my sister&apos;s rooms and they were all empty too.  I was freaked out so I just collapsed in bed, thinking in the morning this will all be resolved.I awoke to a call from my mother that the family left town unexpectedly that evening to visit relatives.Description of the craft:  Closure took over in my perception of the craft, so my brain processed the craft as looking like the time machine in Back to the Future (big fan at the time).  It was the only way my brain could process a floating silent vehicle, that and it also did look a lot like that craft.  It had a metallic brushed reflective surface, with an area like a car where the &quot;people&quot; were transported, and then a front and back section much like our engine and trunk section.  It as the classic saucer shape, but without the dramatic flaring sides.   It had lights in various places on the exterior but it all happened so fast and I was so stunned that I couldn&apos;t tell you the exact placement, but my friend who had no such &quot;stunned&quot; effect because he was already a believer, said he saw lights in the back, front, top and bottom of the craft.For now, any contact, I would prefer it to be done via email.((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident in 1992 is approximate.

It was very high up and was moving north. After a few seconds, it turned right and headed west in a straight line and at the same speed.  A few minutes later, I and my girlfriend noticed other objects like the one I have described and for the next hour and a half we watched 14 or  more of them moving west in a straight line and one consistant speed which was rather slow. Most of the objects looked round but some were triangle shaped.  Most were moving slowly west but, some just hoovered in one spot.  One hoovered for 30 min and then slowly moved north. I went to the army surplus across the street and told the guys working there about the objects.  They got some binoculars and we looked at one of the objects.  Through the bino&apos;s I could see that the object was 3 white orbs held in a triangle frame like thing.  And as we watched another white object moved toward this 3-orbed object and was very neat it before it vanished. All of the objects were very high up.  When jets would pass by , one could see that these objects were way higher in the sky than the jets.The objects made no sound , they made turns, changed directions , and moved in straight lines as well as hovering.  NO high speed stuff.  One thing I noticed, when I was looking at some of these objects, I would notice another similar object  behind the object I was looking at that was much much higher up.((NUFORC Note:",

The sky was clear with just a few scattered clouds. I had originally gone out to see what was happening, as about an hour earlier, a pair of Blackhawk helicopters were circling the area, extremely low with only their battle lights on.  I ended up looking at the stars after they left.  At 2152 hrs I noticed what seemed to be a satellite approaching from the south, about 30 degrees above the horizon. It was moving rather slow for a satellite and moving towards the northwest.  It started as a dim white color but began increasing in size and intensity.  Just when I thought I was about to see a good iridium flare, I realized that instead of flaring and then subsiding, this object was continuing to increase in size and brilliance.  It became huge, larger and brighter than Saturn visible to the west, and the color was now an unusual shade of light green around the edge and brilliant white in the center.  It appeare! d to be self-illuminated and not reflecting the sun.  It remained at its brightest for several seconds, then it suddenly went completely dark for a fraction of a second, then returned with full brilliance.  Concurrent with this display, I noticed a small, white object shooting off to the west at a slight downward angle.  The white object looked like a small, very slow meteor leaving a short trail.  It appeared slightly below the green object and quite a bit to the right of it, but the trajectory of the white object in relation to the green object gave me the impression it had shot out from it. (It is possible that it was just a meteor as there was nothing unusual about it other than its appearance and proximity to the green object.)  The green object, after re-appearing, remained illuminated for a about a second, then rapidly diminished in size and became completely dark. It did not just blink off but seemed to &quot;power down.&quot;At 2202 hrs., I saw a two more objects one after another, almost directly overhead going from south to north. They performed similarly to the large green object, but did not become as bright and they remained white in color.  They too grew in intensity, flashed on and off several times and then went dark.  I checked the Heavens Above website and discovered that there were NO iridium satellites visible from my location on that date, and the other known objects that were visible were not overhead at the times or locations of these sightings.",

The other interesting thing was that it did not move at all in that time &amp; when looking at it with peripheral vision - it seemed to flicker quite rapidly.  However one was unable to see the flickering when looking at it directly.  The flickering was somewhat random, &amp; very rapid, not like a star. During the next roughly 3 hours as we! continued to observe the object, It continued to remain in the exact same location, flicker quite vibrantly &amp; every few minutes it would seem to dissipate for a minute or so, only to return to the same location.  The flickering was quite prominent at times, to the point that it seemed to light up the sky quite visibly in the peripheral vision when not paying too much attention.

Its movement was more floating than flying and was very fluid.  You could not see a definitive shape to the object and it was definitely not a plane.

I have viewed it from several different vantage points, both with the naked eye and with binoculars, a well as taken pictures.  Anybody who looks up at the sky could clearly see it. It is not being shy or covert at all.  It doesn&rsquo;t seem to move much except to make a very slow descent behind the big mountain that makes up one half of the Camarillo grade (101 freeway, where truck scales are), so by 11:30 or so, it ha disappeared from my view. It does appear to change colors occasionally, from brilliant white, to a hazy yellowish orange, to a bluish white glow, and sometimes a red aura appears on the top part of whatever this is. It also appeared to have some much smaller, much dimmer lights come off it in several instances over the past week.  Because there is a military base nearby ( Point Mugu) I at first thought it was some kind of helicopter holding its position in a military exercise of some kind. And it might be just that, I don&rsquo;t know what it is at this point.I wouldn&rsquo;t have even come here to post this, except for a caller I heard on the Coast to Coast  radio show that described how he was seeing a strange bright light in the sky from sundown to 11:30pm, and this had been every evening for the last week or so. He went on to describe the very same characteristics that the light I was seeing possessed. The show host told this caller to report his sighting on this website. So I figured I should do the same with my sighting, for whatever its worth. I unfortunately did not hear where the caller was calling from, but would like to find out if it&rsquo;s the same light or two different ones in two separate places. I guess I will just continue to watch it at night, and to try to get some better pictures of it.((NUFORC Note:  Sighting of Venus in the western sky, we suspect. PD))",

To fully view the light we continued through the densely wooded area to an opening on top of a hill.  The front seat passenger and rear seat passenger tried to identify it as a star, however, it was visibly much larger than any of the other stars in the sky, including Venus and Jupiter.  Also, it was a different color than either of the planets and due to the size, appeared much closer.  As we rounded the road to the top of the hill, about a mile and a half away from sighting the first light, the rear and front seat passengers turned to face the object, which had now drifted to the Northeast.  Upon relocating the object, and getting above the tree line, they noticed another light to the East.  I, the driver, was also able to see the objects clearly.We were only about a half a mile from McHardy Road, which runs North and South; we decided to turn North onto it to get a better view.  While turning and advancing down the road the sky became more visible as the trees receded below us and about three more orange objects were clearly visible.The two passengers kept their eyes one the objects as we proceeded another half mile North on McHardy before pulling over and stopping the vehicle.  It was then 12:07 and we exited the car to watch the objects.  At this time, we decided to call the NUFORC hotline and report the sighting; also there now appeared to be seven orange orbs in the sky.  During this time, the objects seemed to drift or float toward the Northeast slightly, and nearly one by one they faded out.  It did not appear that they moved beyond our visible sight, just that they were fading and no longer present. It took approximately three minutes for the entire group of lights to completely fade (12:10am).About thirteen minutes passed and the lights failed to return so we decided to get back into the car and head East in the general direction of the lights.

The flash event lasted only a brief second, and neither I nor my companions heard any sort of noise in the seconds following the anomaly.I suspect that the flash was caused by a copper or thallium-containing iron meteorite, which would explain the green color of the flash, the lack of accompanying sound, and EMP which knocked out power.

The source was moving wards the north-northeast in a smooth steady motion, which I estimated given its relative distance of roughly one quarter mile from my position to be traveling at between fifty and seventy mph.As it flew, the source appeared to make a small, very smooth deviation from the straight course it had been following when I initially noted it, and in a long lazy arc came to a complete stop in the sky approximately at an angle of sixty degrees above the horizon, wherein it seemed to perform a complete stop and then in a matter of seconds faded away to nothingness (this effect may have been achieved by the source moving away from me on an easterly course, gradually being lost from view, or by some other means).I was able at the time to motion capture approximately fifty-nine seconds of the source objects flight using a Kodak EasyShare C813 8.0 MP camera, which when played back seemed to indicate that it was spinning, and was not entirely orange in color.  Instead, brilliant instances of white and a very brilliant and distinct blue hue were also in evidence.Sadly, due to my initial attempts at sighting the camera on a moving object set against a black sky and under less than ideal circumstances, the initial footage is shaky, but still clear enough for it to be clear enough for analysis.  At the time of the incident, the sky was heavily overcast with broken slow moving clouds.  There was a full moon, and the source appeared to be moving along some distance below the cloud base.  I wish to point out that the route on which the object was seen is part of the regular flight path for aircraft coming into Southampton Airport, yet it was moving counter to the established route and was seen to be carrying lights ((which were not)) consistent with known aircraft.((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS))Peter,My apologies, that was an obvious and somewhat unfortunate mistake on my part. The date should read, July 31st 2010, not August as you so rightly pointed out.  Also, be advised that a small typo should be amended, it is &quot;yet it was moving counter to the established route and was seen to be carrying lights consistent with known aircraft,&quot; which should read:&quot;...yet it was moving counter to the established route and was seen to be carrying lights which were not consistent with known aircraft.&quot;Thank you.  If you are interested in the footage, it is just under 60 seconds long and in MOV format just under 18MB long. If you know of any reliable means wherein I can send that securely without correuption and at a lower file size, I would be interested in hearing about it.  Thank you for contacting me.  I have an additional comment to add.  I have only just learned from my father who lives at the nearby village of Fair Oak, Hampshire, some seven and one half miles from me that on the night of August 25th, approximately 22:50 hours, he observed two independently operating orange spherical light sources.  In the course of the observation, the objects travelled an undisclosed distance, probably no more than one quarter miles knowing the viewpoint that he had, and from south to northeast.  The sighting was terminated when one of the objects stopped abruptly in mid-flight and shot straight up at considerable speed, followed five seconds later by the second, both subsequently vanishing from sight. I can attempt to obtain additional details, but this is certainly curious given the nature of the object that I personally observed and managed to capture in motion.Thanks.((END ADDENDUM))((NUFORC Note:  All requested corrections have been made in the text above.

It was about 400 or 500 feet from us.  There were no airplanes, helicopters, or other crafts seen in the area, at that time.  We were stuck in the line at a drive through restaurant so we were not able to follow it, to see where it was landing.

Our family friend had told us all the flights were delayed or canceled  because of the thunder storm and severe rain we were having.  While we were standing outside his house in the drive way he saw a really bright light. He said, &quot;Come here and look at this.&quot;  I was standing where tree branches were blocking my view so I couldn&rsquo;t see what he was pointing at. When I stepped closer to where he was standing and looked into the night sky I saw a bright hovering disk (it had a disk like shape but the light surrounding it was rectangle).  It was very bright and looked far away, yet the whole craft was brilliantly lit. It emitted a yellow/golden light in color. We both stood looking at the flying object until it flew straight into the clouds.  During the short amount of time we saw the UFO, it maintained the hovering position, not moving anywhere, for about 5 seconds.  Then went up a few feet in the air (from our perspective) and back down to the original position.   After this the UFO flew straight up into the clouds at a super fast speed.  It looked like it disappeared. There were no more lights emitting from the craft.This is my first encounter with anything to do with UFO&rsquo;s or aliens. I can&rsquo;t explain what I saw. I don&apos;t know of any kind of aircraft so bright, has the same shape, can maintain a hover thousands of feet in the air, go at a fast speed straight up and all this during a thunder storm.",

20100806,20100812," Peabody, MA", disk,10 seconds,"Silver disk flew over my backyard, directly overhead, low and slow.On the afternoon of August 6, 2010, I was on a lounge chair in my backyard on the north side of the swimming pool. It was 2:40 pm on a sunny day with a mostly blue sky dotted with a few puffy clouds.  I was facing east and was in the shade cast by the tall bamboo behind me.  Although there was no change in the light, I had a random thought that dark thunderclouds might be coming in from the west and looked up at the sky.  A few seconds later I saw a silver disk travelling from west to east, in a straight line over my pool almost directly overhead.At first glance I thought it was some kid&apos;s silver balloon that got loose but quickly realized it was no floppy, tinfoil balloon, but some kind of solid, firm-surfaced metal. I focused in on it so I could remember as much detail as possible. It was shaped like a disk but also had a squashed circle/egg type shape. The top and bottom were rounded and the sides were slightly rounded, like the shape of a Mento candy. There were no hard edges or seams, no puckers or variations of color or texture in the surface. It was totally smooth and reflective, the bottom of it turning darker as it passed over the green trees at the eastern end of the yard. I&apos;m estimating that it was about 30 feet above the fully mature maple trees, so maybe 60 feet above ground. I got the impression that it might be 3 to 4 feet in diameter. Although it was breezy at the treetops, the disk moved in a straight line, with no side to side wavering or drifting from the wind, and no change in altitude. There! was absolutely no sound emitting from it.After the disk had been in my sight for about 5 seconds I had the presence of mind to call out, &quot;Look up!&quot; to my husband, who was doing some yard work about 20 feet behind me and to the right. Since he was to the right of the edge of the bamboo stand he had a clear view of the disk and looked up in time to see it just as it was going over the trees. His description of the disk corroborated mine. From the time I saw the disk to the time it travelled out of sight was about 8 to 10 seconds and I estimate that the distance it travelled in that time was about 50 to 60 feet. Using these estimates, the disk was travelling at about 3 to 5 miles per hour. Unfortunately there was no time to take a picture, even with my cell phone.I am recently retired but was a government employee for 33 years and my husband works for a major airline. Our eyesight is fine and neither of us requires eyeglasses or contacts for driving. Immediately following this sighting I felt satisfied to have finally seen something concrete and real because it left no doubt that these objects do exist. Then I started wondering whether the fact that they do exist was a good thing or not. Knowing that there is technology far advanced than that held by us here on Earth is a bit unsettling. From our own history we know what usually happens when a technologically advanced civilization meets a less advanced society. I can only hope that whoever is controlling these objects has a less aggressive nature than us humans.  I am not overly worried about it, though, because I feel that if they meant to do us harm, they would have by now.  Perhaps they are just documenting our own self-destruction, via the proliferation of nuclear weapons, p! ollution, greenhouse gases, over population, genocide, chemical farming, antibiotics, destruction of the rainforests, and over fishing?  Maybe we are their version of watching a demolition derby; dirty, ugly and violent, but oh so entertaining!  We told friends about the sighting but, of course, most of them just laughed it off and asked how much we had been drinking at the time (which, by the way, was not at all). We humans do laugh when we are nervous about something, and we don&apos;t want to hear about something that makes us uncomfortable. And the quickest way to shut someone up is to ridicule them. So our friends reactions are normal, but we know what we saw. I don&apos;t think our government could keep such technology a secret.

At 3:20 pm I purchased ice cream for my daughter at the Glen Echo Caf&eacute; and then after walking around, maybe for 10 minutes we sat at a park bench facing the main building area.  My son was with me as well.I looked up at the sky and saw something that appeared round remaining in the same spot.  It was high above the clouds.  I heard a helicopter near by and also saw a plane.  I looked again to see if it was a helicopter but realized that it was too high for me to hear any sound from it.  I remained seated with my kids but chatted with them taking my eyes off what I had seen.After a few minutes I thought I would take another look and sure enough it was in the same spot.  Not knowing what it was-it did look like an unusual speck-I grabbed my camera and took a picture of the sky where I saw it thinking I just might be able to magnify the picture and see it better later at home.  Three minutes later, I zoomed in and took another picture.  I also did a short video clip with a description of what we were looking at.My children did not see it at first but I brought it to their attention by directing them to look in an area in between and above two red turrets and then to follow up the sky to the last cloud.  They did locate it at that point.  I would have to say we were there for at least 10 minutes and it had remained in the same place.When I got home, I was convinced I got nothing but then when I pulled up the picture, I located the spot in the picture and with interest magnified it.  It turned out to be what looked like a metallic sphere reflecting the sun.I am sending a Google Earth picture of the area showing exactly where we were sitting.  I am also including the clearest snap shot with magnification.  On the original picture with the cloud, you cannot see the spot too easily but once you locate it and magnify it, you can view the sphere.The best way to find it is to look at the cloud, move your eyes to the part on the bottom that resembles the map of Italy.  From there look to the right and once you reach the far right side of the cloud, you will see a tiny dot-don&rsquo;t ask me why I even noticed it on such a bright day.I have no idea what it was-a weather balloon?-but as shown by the pictures I took, it had not moved in the space of three minutes.

20100807,20100810," Peebles, OH", circle,&lt;1 minute,"round object with much smaller attached object circling the main object in vertical motionI am a casual amateur astronomer with some working knowledge of the night sky.  I had just begun an evening of stargazing in rural southern Ohio and was planning to start with sightings of Venus, Saturn, and Mars, which were grouped quite close together just after sunset on 8-7-10.  I noticed the object in question while waiting for Venus to appear after sunset.  In terms of brightness it looked a lot like Venus, but it was way too high in the sky to be that planet, and its brightness was probably closer to that of Jupiter, which was not due to appear until much later in the evening.  I thought perhaps it was a very bright star but did not know what star it might be.To attempt to identify the object, I trained my 6-inch Dobsonian with low magnification on the object.  What I saw was a disc, but not a disc in the sense of a flying saucer type object seen edge-on.  Rather, it was perfectly round and about the size of Jupiter on high magnification.  It appeared to have some markings on it somewhat similar to the light and dark areas seen on Mars when that planet is relatively close to Earth.  It did not appear to be moving at all.As I observed the object, I noticed it had a much smaller object which appeared to be circling it, much as you might see the Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter.  But the circling was not horizontal like a natural satellite --- east-west or west-east --- but rather a vertical polar orbit.  As I watched, the smaller object moved from about the 7:00 o&apos;clock position on the main object up to the very top 12:00 o&apos;clock position.  What was even weirder was that the smaller object appeared to be attached to the main object by a line which was very thin but quite visible.All of this happened very quickly, in a matter of a few seconds, and after this brief observation I was mystified as to what the object might be.  I thought perhaps it might be some exotic satellite of which I was unaware.  I took my eye from the telescope so I could just look at it to see if it was moving across the sky in a straight line at a steady rate with a steady brightness the way satellites do.  But when I looked up it had vanished.  Satellites wink out when they enter the earth&apos;s shadow and are no longer illuminated by the sun.  But as far as I could tell this object was not moving at all.  Had it been moving I would have almost certainly noticed some movement of the main object when I was looking at it through the telescope, since magnification also magnifies the perceived motion of an object across the sky. I have never seen anything like this and I am at a loss as to what this object might have been.  I was sober with my faculties intact when I observed it. {:&gt;) If anyone has seen something similar or knows what it may have been I would be interested in some feedback.",

The object was a very bright orange-yellow and I at first thought it might have been an aircraft with its landing lights on.  Its magnitude was far brighter than Sirius.  It is difficult to gauge the size of the object but I would estimate it as subtending half the angle as does a light plane at very high altitude. From our vantage point, looking in a NNW direction, the object was at about 45 degrees from the horizon.

From the West end of Madison, where it intersects with DT, the light was slightly north west, appearing just above the tree line.  I have observed that there is a cell tower in that vicinity, however the light that I saw appeared to be acting more similarly to the light of a lighthouse than the on/off blink of these towers.  The light changed from a large red to a smaller, dimmer yellowish amber - similar to that of stars.  And then it appeared to fly off.

I was located in Spokane Valley, WA and, I was looking directly above me when my sighting took place and the angle of elevation was 90 degrees.  I witnessed approximately 40 or more brightly lit objects/orbs of orange and reddish light in a formation/straight line above me moving east very quickly.  The objects themselves were in motion as they maintained the line formation, and they appeared to move in front of each other and around each other.  Formation then changed shape from a line to a V.  Objects appeared to be the same size as the stars and appeared to be at a high altitude based on my observations.A closed fist at arm&rsquo;s length when the formation/cluster was directly above me covered about 1/10th of the formation.  The cluster of objects was very large across the sky.  No other witnesses were present at time of sighting, and objects made no noise whatsoever as they went overhead from west to east.  Objects then changed shape into a V formation, and then disappeared from view to the east after about ten seconds.  Speed of objects was very fast, covering the sky and off to the east in seconds.  Speed of the objects was constant the whole time.  It was almost hard to follow them because of the speed.  I have been an amateur meteorologist for about 15 years and I watch the sky daily and observe weather conditions and aircraft all the time from my residence.

It was a hot, humid night, clear dark sky, no moon that I could see. To my left, eastward, an object came into view over the treetops.  For a second, I thought it was a full, orange, harvest moon.  It was about the size of a large full moon in the sky and glowed orange. It took me a second to realize that the object was moving, travelling east to west.  I then thought it had to be a meteor. However, this object did not streak or fall, nor did it have a trail. I stood there gaping at it as it passed directly overhead; when it was directly above me the orange glow became an orange &quot;halo&quot; around what i could see was an object with rounded edges.

The UFO also has 2 bright white strobe lights down the middle of the triangle at opposing ends.On Wednesday at about 1am,  August 11,  2010, I was getting out of my truck at work and quickly glanced at an aircraft flying overhead at a low altitude from the south heading toward the north.  At first, I thought that it was a commercial jet, yet as I took a moment to focus my gaze, I realized that there was something unusual about it.   I see commercial jets and helicopters flying over head at times, but I didn&rsquo;t hear any sound from this flying object and that the lights displayed didn&rsquo;t fit the description of a plane or helicopter that I&rsquo;ve seen before.  The UFO travelled at a steady pace similar to a commercial jet until it faded in the distance.  I witnessed this UFO cross overhead from the south heading toward the north for about 10 seconds until it was out of my sight.  I would say that looking north, the UFO was heading north with a slight 10-20 degrees toward the northwest.Other than witnessing the UFO, I did notice a helicopter passing overhead shortly before this sighting.  As I witnessed the UFO, the helicopter appeared further north and from the west.   It stopped in the direction the UFO was heading.

I was scanning the treeline with my binoculars while my friend observed with his eyes.  Through my binoculars I noticed a cluster of several hexagonal yellow lights. This was not a constellation, or any star formation.  It immediately stunned me because I am very familiar with the area as I go there all the time, it is one of the best places to see the sky clearly close to Morgantown.  I got my friend&apos;s attention and observed it with my naked eye. It was a large, quarter size at arm&apos;s length, cluster of hexagonal lights blinking on and off.   We could not tell for sure if this was several objects hovering together, or lights on a larger craft, but it did appear that it was a singular craft as we were both able, through binoculars, to see smaller objects flying around the craft.  Both of us felt frightened by what we saw.   We observed the object for about 25 minutes. It never moved suddenly or swiftly but it did appear to be getting smaller and! farther away as the sighting went on.   Eventually, we left as it was getting late.  The object was still observable when we headed home.I do want to remain totally anonymous, as I never report the objects we witness in that area, but I decided to submit this account because it was an especially startling sighting and unlike anything I or my friend had seen before.

This was like if an edge of a coin were lit up in a line and it wasn&rsquo;t really moving.Then it slowly tilted with purpose (again this was strange to me because if it were a man made prop or something far away the effort to so even would be quite difficult) like when you weigh something with those doctor scales and you get the lead weight right it kind of has this slow settling into place as it gets its balance.  Like that. It tilted in that &lsquo;gaining balance&rsquo; way for another 20 degrees tilting down on the right side.Suddenly it looked like it was moving forward away from me for a moment and then I got this sense of a burst of incredible speed because the lights became smaller so quick they practically winked out they were gone so fast.I was not tired.

When I was getting bored of watching, something finally caught my eye., I thought, &quot;A meteor!,&quot; but another thought popped into my head; this meteor wasn&rsquo;t moving.   After about 10 minutes of watching this orb of light it quickly moved down and to the left, on slightly but it moved nonetheless.  The orb left a small trial, like a jet, but it disappeared within 20 seconds or so. Then 5 minutes or so afterwards, it again shifted; up and to the left.  Again it left a tail and it&rsquo;s tail vanished.The orb was a white color with an ever so slight hint of blue.I attempted to photograph this phenomenon but it would not show up on my camera (Kodak EasyShare P712) it did though show in a few pictures but with much movement of my hands I couldn&rsquo;t get a clear shot.I am unsure of  what I saw, I know that that light was not there on an ordinary night, and I also had the thought that it could be a star, but stars don&rsquo;t move (well not that fast anyway)!

Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the plane lights wavering behind the tree&apos;s as the aircraft approached. I had assumed that it was a plane anyways.  I sat at the glass door for a moment, watching the lights approach as I usually did- out of habit more than anything.As the seconds passed, I noticed that the aircraft seemed to be rising forward into the air at an accelerating velocity- one that seemed almost unusually fast.  I continued to watch in curiosity.  In less than a second, the aircraft made a 390 degree turn, a full circle and then off to the right. There was no way it could be a plane, so I ran outside to see it better.As it flew above the tree-line, I noticed that the lights didn&apos;t look anything like the ones on a plane and the shape of the vehicle was extremely unusual.  The lights were not sharp and pronounced, but instead were hazy and burned like fire, scattered about the bottom and sides of the UFO. They were pale yellow to bluish-green in color and seemed to be linked by thinner lines of light.The UFO itself was not a sleek thin design like I might have imagined it to be.  The main body appeared dark grey and semi-metallic (it reminded me of silicon) and pyramidal, but had abstract shaped parts attached to the main body, creating a shape that is nearly indiscernible to describe from such a short observation period.It continued off to the right for a moment before all of the lights on the aircraft immediately shut off.  I could still see the body due to light pollution and a faint glow that seemed to radiate from the UFO, preventing it from becoming completely hidden.  It changed course in a matter of milliseconds and accelerated again in a sharp upward direction before it was out of eyesight.I watched for a little longer and saw something that made me almost laugh in awe.  What I could see to be as several military fighter jets came into my sight only moments later, uniformly chasing in the same direction I had seen the unidentified aircraft travel before disappearing.

It was about twice the size of Venus (as it appears during this time of year).  At first I thought maybe it was an abnormally bright light on top of a radio tower or that it was Venus but since it was larger, brighter and had a steady glow, I started to think maybe it was a plane or helicopter falling from the sky...  It looked like a ball of fire and it moved at a slow, steady speed downwards toward the horizon (I stopped my car for a moment to make sure it was actually moving).  Then it gradually started to move diagonally towards the north, then almost completely parallel to the horizon and then down until I could no longer see it because of trees on the horizon.While I have no idea how large it was or how far away it was, it was about 40 degrees from the eastern horizon when we first saw it.  It also had a steady glow, didn&apos;t twinkle or fade out or anything.  Just stayed a constant brightness comparable to Venus&apos;s but white with a slightly orange outline and an almost burning appearance (which might not make it a steady glow... but it didn&apos;t flicker or anything.  It just seemed to &quot;boil&quot; slightly as a ball engulfed in flames would).I considered the idea that it could be something someone had shot into the air, like some sort of firework that came falling to the ground but it appeared to be very far away and thus would be quite large (I&apos;m not sure if you can really measure the distance of something with no idea what the object is... or how large it is... so this guess is based on the fact that the trees in the horizon were probably a mile away or so).",

At about 10:30, we all laid on the deck and were enjoying the clear skies, stars, and a few meteors.Shortly after 11, my sister&rsquo;s boyfriend pointed out a very bright glow (appeared golf ball sized) to the east.  We all sat up to look, at first thinking it was a meteor.  The light appeared to be getting closer.  After 30 seconds or so, we knew it wasn&rsquo;t a meteor because we could see the light was coming from some type of aircraft.  It appeared to be a headlight, the beam went out into the night sky like a flashlight.  It was NOT a spotlight&mdash;it did not shine down.  The craft continued to move forward, it was moving west.  On one side of the craft was a small blue light and on the other side a small red light, similar to airplanes.  As the craft moved overhead we could see it was triangular shaped and was close, not so close where we&rsquo;d be alarmed but closer than airplanes normally fly.  We watched as the craft very quietly moved west , dipped and glided toward the north, dipped down and up a few more times, and was finally out of view.We were all stunned at what we saw and returned to the deck to continue watching for meteors.  Less than 5 minutes later from the same point in the sky, the bright yellow circular glow appeared again.  We witnessed the same thing again with the same (if not very similar) flight pattern.  This time we all heard what we describe as a &quot;whirring&quot; noise.  After this one was out of view we began to walk from the front yard to the back yard again when we immediately saw another one of the exact same appearance.  This led us to believe there were minimally 2 separate crafts since our 2nd sighting had vanished only seconds earlier.My sister&rsquo;s boyfriend left at 11:40 p.m..

However, this time the glow hovered at a farther distance for several minutes.  It did not move overhead to reveal the triangular shaped aircraft, but instead simply hovered.My sister and I stayed outside until approximately 2:00 a.m. (8/13/10) and saw a few more meteors but did not have another sighting of the aircraft.

I have taken into consideration that this could be it a meteor, but I have come to the conclusion that it was not a meteor.I was sitting on the couch in my living room watching for meteors the would inevitably come into view tonight. When I was getting bored of watching, something finally caught my eye.  I thought, &ldquo;a meteor!&ldquo;, but another thought popped into my head; this meteor wasn&rsquo;t moving. After about 10 minutes of watching this orb of light it quickly moved down and to the left, on slightly but it moved nonetheless. The orb left a small trial, like a jet, but it disappeared within 20 seconds or so. Then 5 minutes or so afterwards, it again shifted; up and to the left. Again it left a tail and it&rsquo;s tail vanished.The orb was a white color with an ever so slight hint of blue.I attempted to photograph this phenomenon but it would not show up on my camera (Kodak EasyShare P712) it did though show in a few pictures but with much movement of my hands I couldn&rsquo;t get a clear shot.I am unsure of  what I saw, I know that that light was not there on an ordinary night, and I also had the thought that it could be a star, but stars don&rsquo;t move (well not that fast anyway)!

The objects were triangular in shape, vertical with the apex pointing straight up. Inside the triangles were undulating white, green and red lights that morphed around inside the triangles like colored bubbles inside a lava lamp.  Each triangle was about the size of a dime at arm&rsquo;s length.Initially the triangles passed from the south toward the north in a somewhat horizontal path and stopped due east about 45 degrees above the horizon.  At the same time I saw an airplane pass in front of the triangles and then I saw a satellite pass over them. They were bigger than the jet airliner so they must have been at least 100 feet on a side. The objects were distinctly different from either the airliner or the satellite. The objects were about as high as the plane and beyond it a ways. Once the triangles stopped, they slowly moved around in the sky, up, down and sideways with no particular pattern to their movements.  At times they hovered nearly still in their positions and then they would resume their dance.  The objects were never touching and did not remain adjacent to one another.  Eventually they started moving directly upward.  The triangle on the right stayed in position lower than the one on the left.As I watched the objects ascend, a deer entered my yard and startled me.

Though I thought this was unusual, we dismissed it and looked elsewhere in the sky for signs of the meteors.  When I returned my attention to the star, I found that it had moved Westward and toward the horizon significantly.  We then watched its motions for several minutes, noting first to ourselves and then aloud that the object was swinging strangely from side to side.  This seemed curious especially due to its apparent distance from us.  If the presumed object seemed to us the size of a very bright star and it was performing such wide swinging motions and there was only a slight breeze that night, I assumed this might not be a conventional aircraft or an object being manipulated by air currents.Thinking the rapid movements of our eyes may have caused this pattern of movement, I scanned the sky for a star and attempted to produce the same affects but could not.  The motion seemed to be real and not a product of autokinesis.We procured my Meade ETX-70AT Telescope upon my boyfriend&apos;s suggestion.  Magnification did not clarify any apparent shape of the object.  At times it is obscured by clouds.

It was a beautiful, clear night with no moon.  Jupiter was hanging high over head and slightly to the south at this hour.  There were several nice meteors, two brilliant ones of note, but the rest were just tiny little streaks.  I was getting a little bit bored with looking at the same section of sky so I looked back over towards the South.  I could see Jupiter shining through the fabric of the sunshade but off to the side of the shade and directly overhead, I noticed a bright, smaller, pale, bluish, white light.  I was confused since I knew it wasn&apos;t another planet and I hadn&apos;t remembered seeing a star that was that bright. As pondered this anomaly, it just slowly faded out.  While my eyes adjusted tracking around it&apos;s position, I then got this bizarre motion sensation which really bugged me out since I was sitting stationary.  I realized then that it wasn&apos;t me that! was moving, it was a tiny light that my eye had fixed upon, it was no brighter than the background stars, and it was moving slowly towards the South.  That&apos;s when I noticed it wasn&apos;t alone.  There were two distinct, small points of light moving perfectly in unison together with one ahead of the other at a slight angle from my perspective, there was a decent gap between the two, about an inch and a half to two inches if you measured between two fingers of an outstretched hand.   A jet flying at a high altitude with it&apos;s standard running lights flashing also happened to fly overhead a moment later, but towards the East at a completely perpendicular angle to the lights.  I don&apos;t think the jet&apos;s appearance was related, as I could tell it (the jet) was much, much closer that the lights.  What ever I was seeing had to be at an extremely high altitude, possibly in orbit or possibly in outer space.  I honestly don&apos;t know what I saw tonight but it just gave me the chills.  I thought, maybe it was two objects at first, but then I wondered, what! if it w as just one, extremely long object that was dimly illuminated at either end?  I&apos;ve seen a few weird things in my life, but nothing like this.  Please don&apos;t think I&apos;m crazy, I&apos;m usually pretty skeptical about these things, but to actually see it with my own eyes...  I don&apos;t know what else to say.

We are both in our mid-20s, college graduates, work regular jobs, have NO experience with UFOS or aliens.  While travelling back to port at Seattle from Victoria, BC, we happened to notice a meteor shower during the late evening of August 12th.  We ended up watching this meteor shower for several hours.  The meteors were amazing, ranging in many sizes and colors.  Around 1:40am (now Friday the 13th), my boyfriend noticed something unusual in the sky.  He saw two uniform spheres of light appear in the sky, move in a figure 8 motion, and then disappear.  He quickly tried to explain this to me in his bewildered state, but within a few seconds these two lights appeared in the sky again and we both saw them.  The spheres were always equidistant apart, as if they were attached by some invisible pole, and danced around each other very quickly and sharply.  The lights moved in a zig zag pattern, back and forth for abo! ut 5 seconds before flying a straight path over the ship and we could no longer see them from our balcony.  The lights were a little larger in comparison to the stars and seemed to appear from mid air in the sky.  We sat in shock for a very long time, trying to come up with a logical explanation, and hoping to see them again. These lights were absolutely not meteors, they moved in several different directions and left no light tail, and they were solid white lights, no blinking or shimmering. We also thought that possible the military was trying some new type of aircraft, maybe a new invisible plane and all we could see were the two lights on it?   But there was no sound, and with the speed these lights were traveling I&rsquo;d expect a very loud rocket sound.  So my theory is now that these lights were either one or two UFOs, maybe aliens use meteor showers to hide their arrivals?   I would definitely love to know if there is a logical explanation, I don&rsquo;t think I will ever stop wondering what we saw and it may just drive me crazy!

Half of me still thinks there is no way I could have seen a UFO and there has to be some explanation, but the other half knows that there is nothing on Earth I know of that moves like that, and there is no way we both could have imagined seeing the exact same thing.  To be honest, I feel a little crazy.  I&apos;ve always believed in other life, its bogus to think that we are the only living planet in an unimaginably vast galaxy,  I guess I just never expected to see for myself.

We saw several bright shooting stars before a brief rainshower passed through and everyone bugged out.  Took everyone home, and by the time everyone was home, it had cleared up again, so I decided to drive back up the mountain to see the peak by myself.  I arrived at about 3:30 AM, parked and set out in my chair behind my car with all lights off... about one or two per minute for at least an hour! Ink black sky, Milky way easily visible with the naked eye.  It was beautiful.  Then, I noticed something flashing through the trees to the east. It was a VERY brigh pure white light flashing so brightly it could be seen through the treeline, very low.  I waited for it to pass from behind the trees, and it raised in altitude and changed from a single white light brighter than any star in the sky to a row of 2-3 ! orange lights in a line, which seemed to pulsate or move left to right.  What scared me was the maneuverability.  This thing was flying &quot;S&quot; shaped patterns up and down over the treeline, estimated max altitude 2000 ft., apparent size as big as a pinky fingernail width at arms length.  It started flying in the same direction as the road I drove up to get to the lookout, and I got scared, so I instantly popped my trunk, folded my chair and threw it in as fast as aI could and hit the &quot;unlock&quot; button on my car. As soon as the car unlocked, all the car lights went on, and I thought &quot;SH*T&quot;!  I looked up, and the three orange lights became one much brighter orange light, almost looked like it was shining something at me, like it saw me.  I instantly hopped in my car, cranked it and tried to run in a panic... the car cranked very very slowly for a few seconds, and the lights dimmed before it started up and I drove away. I was scared because I had to drive in the direction of the thing to get out of there so I floored it very fast, narrowly missing a deer.Looked up, and at one second could see the thing through my winshield, which scared me even more. I didn;t feel safe until the road went under the dense tree canopy. There was no noise at all, and no contrails. All I can say is, never again by myself.  Been up there several times to look at stars with people, and we often see solid lights at high altitude on ballistic trajectories, probably satellites, but this was low and bright, and abnormal.

It flew just about right over us, as it got right above us it was about 3-400 feet up and it flew through a small cloud as it got right above us that was when we heard a very low like rumbling sound nothing like a plane at all, but when it entered the cloud those huge spot lights in the front lit up the whole cloud and it illuminated the whole craft in like a golden aura, that was when the 2 of us really got a good look at it and I can say it scared the hell out of us both!! It looked like a large triangle, the first thing my friend said was holy shit look at that it looks like a pyramid flying over us!! It had the 2 large lights in the front and one large strobe in t! he back there were no other standard lights at all on this thing! what I saw was what looked like a pyramid sitting on top of this black triangle I also saw well the only way I can describe it as a half of an arch going from half way from the rear point of the triangle from the front arching up to this pyramid shape that was on top of the triangle.On the inside of this arch looking part on the pyramid part it looked like either a row of six windows that were illuminated from inside with a golden light or maybe it was just a row of 6 golden lights. It wasn`t moving very fast at all, maybe like 40-50 MPH because we got a good look, as it went over us for I would say maybe 4-5 seconds. On the right side of the road, is a row of pine trees as it went over these trees, I jumped out of the car and ran to the other side of the road just past the row of trees is a swampy area roughly a quarter of a mile across then you hit the rest of the woods.It looked to us like it had dropped even lower when it passed the first row of trees to where I thought it was either going to land or crash into this swampy area, but when I got to the tree line I could see this thing start to move back up and over the wooded area on the other side of the swamp, and it  seemed to just blink out of sight.I have never seen anything like this in my life, and I have seen a lot of different aircraft, I am a Navy vet that served during the Gulf war.I have been trying to draw what I saw but I am not a very good artist, after we got back in the car I realized my new cell phone had a camera and does take video I am really kicking myself in the butt for not thinking of using the phone to either video it or at least get a few snap shots of this thing!",

or &apos;between&apos; the segments, althogh if i had, i would have noticed.at this point the crescent moon had set, i suspect that this object was high enough to gather ambient light enough from the same source as our satellites (the sun), and reflect it back. it could have been picking up the glow of the moon below the horizon, or ambient city light glow.   the sight of it also gave me the impression that somehow it was absorbing most of the light, like it was cloaked.  my only other thought on what this was like would be an airplane flying with no lights at all.  it still does not explain the shape of the object, or the apparent formation change during flight.there was no sound, no smell, no vibrations, no strange feelings during this sighting.  i live approximately 6 minutes by commercial air travel from newark airport (25 miles or so by car) and wonder if anything showed on radar (if this thing was low enough).   becouse i am an experienced sky observer, i believe that this is indeed a ufo, unless there are man made crafts that can appear as i have described.  when i first saw this object, i remembered to be as observant as possible and kept in mind real life comparisons for a good description. i have searched the internet for descriptions or videos that are similar.  when i find something i will be in touch.  i am only sorry i did not have my hd camcorder ready, although i am not sure this would have shown up in video without more hi-tech equipment.  i get annoyed at some of the ufo reports that lack in detail, or have poor descriptions. and i want to be as detailed as possible.to demonstrated my observational skills and knowlege: previously, i have seen many things that seemed unexplainable in the night sky.  i came to no conclusions until i thought through what i had seen.  there was a reasonble explanation, no matter how fantastic it seemed at the time.   two of these previous sightings are as follows:  one object i had seen was a very bright round falling object in the southeastern sky in mid october. a peice of it had also fallen away below it like molten silver, i watched it fade after about 5 minutes. it made no noise although it looked like it would hiss like a fire if you could hear it.   it was either a shooting star coming directly at me that broke up into two peices, or a rocket booster falling away after lauch. this occured around 3 am and i was too tired to look it up, but i am sure that is what it was.the other object was a very distant, large bright green flair in a cold winter northeastern sky, a green so brilliant, like the the color green a diamond reflects in the sunlight.  this flair left a trail and it traveled in horizontal fashion, taking much longer than fireworks to fade. there was no sound. this was probably a military flare from a marine vessel (i live close to the waters west of new york city and staten island--close enough to observe a flare from the water there if it was shot high enough).the exact dates of these occurences have long been forgotten, because i knew they were easily explained.  at the time, they were surprising and amazing to see.i am an expereinced amateur sky watcher.  i would like to point out that i know the difference between the most obscure explanaions for identifiable objects, and an unidentified flying object.  i have seen almost every kind of non-ufo expample in the day and night sky -- so i do know the difference.  i hope there is some logical explanation for this.  i have never seen anything like this before.ok for preliminary email contact by nuforc investigator.  thanks.",

I pulled my Cellphone Camera out that was seeing to get a little light in background so it would show up on camera and luckilty it was past the the brightest star in the sky.  As I was unzooming my camera from the setting I had it on when the cellphone camera was in my hands I was using a Sony Ericsson C905a Cellphone Camera.  As I was filming it went past I said Here comes a Fast one.  Than I said It&apos;s coming faster this time. Than I said as I was unzooming I said Right Past this Star. Than I said It&apos;s going right past this star Right now. Than I said shouting there it is I got it on Camera.  Than said I got it. Than I said I got you on Camera boy.  Than I said hows it going dude. Than I said Yeah. Than I said in a studdering voice it got to be a UFO.  Than I said this is not than shockingly said ohhh a Meatorite just fell down that i wish I wou! ld of got that on camera. After that the camera shuts off after 47 seconds. I caught 27 seconds on film. The 20 seconds was me getting the camera out of zoom and waiting for it to come towards a better light source that big star in the sky. There was a some what alot of shacking in the camera footage while filming. The object was half the size of the star. The Star was 85 percent brighter than the object that was moving fast. The footage was taped at 4:52 AM. Footage is hard to see it but i have good contact lenses and can see good clearly. The Bad News is when I try to send this footage named MOV00025 to my email like I do with all my videos it says when I try to send the Cellphone is reading (Cannot add Video. Message will be to Large.) File Size is only 1.4MB and that should be able to send from my Cellphone to my Email.  The video is stored in my Phone Memory as MP4 just like all my other camera footage. Why is this too large when at 5 Am I am filming another one or the ! same one that is 2.7 MB and that one will send but not worth s! ending.Why is 1.4MB to large to send and 2.7MB is ok to send from Camera phone that don&apos;t make sense I think what I was filming sent me a Virus?  I have a AVS Editor I wanted to use to edit the cellphone camera footage file so I can gett a better view on my Windows XP Computer. The transfer file area does not work with the USB 2.0 plug my Cellphone came with the software for transfer says for windows XP says can&apos;t be added to this computer when uploaded the software my cellphone came with. Sending to Video DJ on Cellphone don&apos;t work  Either. Next try to send it to a memory Card once I order one if that will work.  Well anyways the ufo made no sound and over my head in a 360 direction past the sun over parents house as I was on the front sidewalk and saw it for almost 2 minutes until it was too far to see.  Than at 5 oclock it might of been back again it was about 6 blocks away coming back in the background in my back yard. I was flash the camera light at it trying to communicate with it.((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.  PD)),

20100814,20100814," Caledon (from Brampton) (Canada), ON", light,8 minutes,"String of 12 pulsing lights travelling from west and fading out northeast over Caledon, ONMy eldest daughter, son and I were having pizza at our kitchen table at about 21:15 EDT this evening when I saw two bright lights flying in tandem from the west toward the northeast over Caledon. I have worked in aviation for over 20 years and have seen a lot of aircraft so I asked them if they wanted to see something interesting. As we walked outside we noticed two more behind these, then two more seemingly flying in pairs but fairly evenly spaced overall. The moon was partially obscured in the western sky but there were few clouds and the winds were calm.The string of lights were yellowish-orange in colour, somewhat like the sodium street lamps in our neighbourhood. They were slowly pulsing and as they travelled at what would appear to be aircraft takeoff and climb speeds (200-300 knots), they turned to a more northerly course and faded out. There were no visible beacons or other lights on the objects (what caught my attention in the first place).  I ran inside to get my phone to see if it could record the event on video, but the quality was too poor to detect the lights and only recorded our commentary.As I came back outside we watched in amazement as the count increased to eight, then ten and finally twelve with about six visible at any one time (the others had turned north and faded out in sequence).  We noticed that they appeared to be climbing from the Georgetown area to the west and did not all follow the exact same course, some turning north before others did.  I observed one passing behind a cloud and then emerging again just before fading out completely and none of them ever stopped pulsing, they just appeared to dim as they got farther away.  I thought they must be helicopters to have maintained their formation so I asked my daughter to run in and shut off the air conditioning but there was no detectable sound so they may have been too far away.I could see no other aircraft in the immediate airspace, but saw one to the south heading north (presumably from Pearson International Airport) that may have observed them.  After the last light faded away, an aircraft flew overhead with the familiar beacons of a passenger jet and it was obvious to all of us that these lights in the sky appeared to be something different.",

Noticed a brightly flashing object in the WSW sky.  Thought it was an airplane because it had several different colors being displayed.  It was the brightest object in the sky except for Jupiter which was to the east area of the sky.  Moon not visible as it had already set.As I watched I realized the flashing lights did not move in relation to the trees in the yard of the house next door to the south of me.  After 5 minutes (40 miles of jet airliner flight distance) it still remained in the same position.I walked to where my driveway meets the street some 100 feet west of where I first spotted them to get a better view of the lights.  They were still in the same place.I returned to my house side door and retrieved my 20X80 binoculars to determine if I could see anything with the use of them.  Going back to the driveway entrance I used the binoculars and could see that the lights were changing colors and very quickly.  Red, blue, white, green colors were visible with the glasses but of course the image was all over the place. I placed them on the top of the fence post at the entrance of my driveway and although it steadied the image somewhat it was still only a bouncing globe of lights moving around.  Like trying to watch a star with high power glasses, almost impossible.Although I watched the lights for about 30 minutes, less the time to get the binoculars, they appeared to remain the same intensity and with multicolors.The position was about where I would expect to see Arcturus, the star the tail of the Big Dipper leads to.  Maybe it was that star, although I have looked at it hundreds of times, including from the flight deck of jet airliners.  I have never noticed it have coloring and flashing brightly like it did tonight.The object was about 35 degrees above the horizon and the sky is clear although there could have been some smoke from the forest fires that occur this time of year adding particulates to the atmosphere and perhaps giving a view that I have never seen before.I stopped watching at 23:45.",

20100814,20100815," Ft. Buchanan (Puerto Rico),", circle,30 seconds,"Black object at least  20,000 ft. up, over a highly restricted air zone in a military base, most likely undetected by radar.I walked outside to check out a thunderstorm that was brewing near my house, I thought that maybe it was going to become severe like one thunderstorm that came by a few days ago.  When I looked at the edge of the thundercloud, I saw a completely black object at least 20,000 ft. up in the atmosphere. The object was so high up that I couldn&apos;t make out any details, only could I make out very general details.  The object moved slowly and smoothly and no engine sound was emitted, of course it was so high up. Although the object was to small to be an airliner, and it was way of course the usual plane route. My house happens to be under a MAJOR plane route and every single day at least 150 planes fly above my house, so I&apos;m quite familiar with planes because I see them so often. I strongly believe that the object WASN&apos;T a bird, because I really doubt they fly so high up, we do have a lot of birds in Puerto Rico anyways! Well before I could get someone to see it for th! emselves or a camera at least, the object dissappeared behind a cloud. What interests me is that the flying object was flying over a highly restricted air zone, here in Ft. Buchanan, only military helicopters and commercial airliners are allowed to fly over the base.  I&apos;d really like that government officials have a better eye out on the sky around here, who knows if the object was a threat?  If it was human, it could have dropped a bomb, don&apos;t you agree?  But I highly doubt it was human anyway, it was moving in a way so smooth, that no other plane I&apos;ve seen has ever flown so gracefully.",

I myself in the driver seat while my mother riding up front, sat in the passenger seat.  When the sighting occurred my mother and I were the only ones who were able to witness it because my girlfriend and my nephew sat in the back seat, meanwhile my nephew was sound asleep.Next, we seen a streak of light above us, similar to a shooting star.  First it appeared to be a shooting star, then in astonishment, it appeared to be in a horizontal oval, it didn&apos;t just shoot through the sky fading from sight.  At the sight of this abnormal object it seemed to be traveling in the same direction we were headed, but to my suprises not as slow as an airplane or helicopter, and at first not as fast as a shooting star.  Yet it seemed to be going at an acceptionally fast speed.  It also didn&apos;t have any sound, in reference to any airplane or jet.  Which a jet would have been a good explanation except the fact that a jet doesn&apos;t fly silently.In addition, this object in the sky didn&apos;t appear to be flying at a high altitude.  In fact it seemed pretty low as if it were a helicopter trying to find someone or something.  At first it was just a stream of light then it came lower then it was, not by much but still a little lower.  Then it suddenly picked up speed and the aluminescence grew into a stream of light trailing a ball of light.  Then it seemed to reach a higher area in the sky and at this moment it changed colors immediately from white, to red, then instantly blue and within a fraction of a second it was gone.  It almost seemed to have maybe gone behind a thick cloud, due to the weather we&apos;ve been having.  Then my mother and I realized, there wasn&apos;t any clouds in the immediate area of the night sky.Ultimately, the sight was both shocking and surprising, given it all occured within the most two seconds, or less.  I confidentally believe what I witnessed wasn&apos;t anything in our United States technological capabilities, unless it was an SR-71 Blackbird in central Floridas air space.  It&apos;s one of the only flying objects to my knowledge that would fly close to the speed, without sound, and disappear from sight instantaniously with little conflict, compared to what I witnessed.  Besides the SR-71 doesn&apos;t hit an immediate &quot;warp speed&quot; and aluminate in red then blue and disappear.  I know it sounds tampered with but the object had a blunt oval shape to my sight, possibly due to the engle of visual but to my knowledge it was practicaly oval.",

This has caught my attention because the light never went away. At one point the trajectory of the rocket stands still and begins to transform into a small disk and started approaching the city and the area of observation. I left the area of the bridge and sticked close to a building that could give me a possibility of covered area but continued to attend the same approach. However, the subject held his course, and exhibited an additional light that turned towards the bridges. Returned to walk in another direction, for example, approaching the other side and turned his light towards a monument. When the subject has stopped in the area of observation it was almost over my head. While standing on top of the observation zone, its light (which to me seeme! d a kind of probe) directed her toward the area of nightlife  and then went in the direction of the bridge next to the West . Being the nearest point of observation, I note the discoid shape of the object, brown with a more nebulous area in the base bottom center of the disc, giving the idea that this area is moving. The object was low in altitude, no more than 100 meters. The subject did not exhibit any noise or sound. Returning to move slowly forward until the next bridge, also changing its path. Stopped over this (where many people walked) and drove his light / probe towards the main street and monument of the city. Speeding up and leaned for a moment seemed to gain a little altitude and then dive (giving the notion of sudden loss of altitude) towards the northwest on the horizon of observation (almost like land), disappearing.

I photographed two jets passing and waited. Just them at 10.39.24 i see a silver star appear exactly were i saw the V UFO yesterday. I jumped up with my camera totally pumped and excited aimed the camera and it wouldnt focus, i switched to manual and shot, switched to auto and shot more. The Probe started moving slowly to the east from the west with the direction of the wind, clouds were slowly passing by it. As the probe passed over head i tried to get some video but it would nt work  i started shooting as best i could, i then see a jet coming rite at the Probe and i thought the probe would disapear but i didnt, the people in the jet must have seen the probe as it passed pretty close but both jet and UFO were in a light fuzz hazzy cloud, my camera wouldnt focus, the jet then went by, i shot more, ! then another jet was coming rite at it again and it passed by in another fuzzy cloud, my camera wouldnt focus, if the pilots missed it they shouldnt be pilots i thought. I was alittle frustrated because the jet and UFO would had been great shots. As i shot more photos a jet higher up than the UFO came from the East heading West i snapped great focused shots of the UFO and jet. As the UFO probe headed to the east towards the tree i ripped off as many shots as i could until it went out of sight. In total i got 110 shots as it passed overhead. I then felt it wasnt over so i waited looking around for a few minutes seeing nothing, i grabbed the camera coffee and radio swatting mosquitoes in the miserable zombie heat and headed in the house, i looked over the far trees and over them i saw a flashing object moving west, reminded me of snow goose in flight then i remembered my Chatham sighting of the object that flashed like a snow goose, i quickly sat my coffee and radio down turn! ed as fast as i could to shoot it and it was gone in a split s! econd, i t could have been a Ring-Billed gull, but ill never no cause i missed it!!. In the house processing i picked the best, focused and silver shinny shots of the craft and enlarged and enhanced them. in all the photos there seems to be some sort of plasma dripping out of the craft in every shot. Also in a couple of shots there seems to be a black dot on the bottom of the whatever it is. Awsome! im so pumped up over this sighting.

(would be bright then go out)...then return to its position. the person sitting next to me witnessed the same movement for verification. another coincidental weird factor was the thunder lightening and showers that followed twenty minutes later. the skies were crystal clear ...the storm rolled in ...thundered and lightening ...rained then went away like nothing ever happened. i think the storm might be a coincidence just due to the fact that the entire sighting was so overwhelming? but we saw an orange ball of light. we saw our first Unidentified Flying Object.the next day there was a millitary huey helicopter that flew around for a couple hours as well. again that could have been a coincidence...but i think the nearest military helo pad is about an hour away?,

We were at an intersection Hulmeville and Gibson when we saw a really bright light moving across the sky way in front of us.  We got a green light and started moving towards the direction the light was going; however, it now was coming in our direction.It seemed to have made a complete turnaround in a matter of 25 seconds or less.  It then changed direction again crossing over Hulmeville road.  At this point I still was not convinced until I got away from some of the high trees and saw it had stopped.  It was just sitting in the sky about maybe 800 feet up give or take.  At this point the brighter lights were no longer on just 3 dull lights (white) and one red light which were not blinking.  All the lights though were dull at this point even the red one.Then I rolled my window down and heard nothing.  I could hear cars, people, and one point even crickets but no sounds that something should make just hovering there in the sky.  It then slowly started to turn and the point or tip of the triangle was pointing downward as it rotated.  Then we had to keep moving and it slowly started crossing the houses over school nearby.  The sighting was about 5 minutes but we turned around about 5 extra minutes to get back to that area and we could not see it anywhere.We looked and looked and nothing.  I believe it was the same craft design wise that me and my ex saw in December 8th 2002 in Croydon.  I believe that this is probably our spacecraft that are reverse engineered off of Alien spacecraft.  This and the one in 2002 are mostly TR-3B or a variant of it.",

By the time I got to the parking lot, the object had flown out of sight behind some hills.  We got in the car to drive a bit in the general direction it went and see if we could spot it again, but we couldn&apos;t see due to all the hills in the area.  About five minutes later, we headed to our apartment building.  We went to let the dog use the bathroom and that was when I spotted the object, headed back in the same direction it came from.  It looked like a jet with no wings, and it made no sound. I could not see any markings.  It appeared to be rolling like a barrel as it made its way through the sky.  My boyfriend estimated it to be at 1,000 ft. altitude.  He also saw an antenna on the craft which I did not notice.  We watched it for about a minute until it flew out of sight.

As soon as they saw it one of the girls said that&apos;s a UFO, we didnt even tell her what we thought it was. The other girl saw it and ran into the house because she was afraid. The girl got her ride and we still sat watching it.The object then started to dim, then brighten, then go even more dim still. as it did this it moved slightly up, then stopped;slightly left, stopped; and up once more and stopped. The whole time my two other friends were trying to call the people we knew in the apt., but none of there phones were working.We were thinking it was getting bigger for a moment, then i realized it was coming straight toward us. the object moved very slow and was completely silent. when it did reach us, it was 100% lined up with our position, i mean when we looked up it was not to the left or to the right, it was right on top of us! we waited for it to pass a little then ran inside our friends apt. to try and get them to come out to see it. they came out as it was nearly passing the apt. complex&apos;s walls.We watched it fly into the distance when it suddenly split into to separate lights with a good amount of distance between the two. we watched it until we couldn&apos;t see it any more. The whole experience lasted about 15-16 mins.

The stealth bomber was sighted slightly more south than my town, which is the direction it was heading, coming from the north.

It was very high in the sky and passing under and threw the clouds.  I called the guy who was putting the carriages away and told him to look up at it.  He did and he saw it too.  I said its not a plane or a helicopter or a jet and he agreed.   We both thought maybe it was an airship shaped in a rectangle shape.  It looked like it had windows on one side and the back three quarters was a light blue color with occasional strobe lights on each side.  It glided slowly across the sky and into the clouds.  Later, I looked up Airships on the internet and found out that there are many types of airships nowadays and that some are even shaped like ! sauser ufos and that they now have passenger rides on airships and that companies make personal airships for people customized to whatever shape or design they want.  Also learned that the Army has made one the size of a football field to do spy work over Aphghanistan and saw a picture of another unmanned spy airship that looks like a ufo.

It seemed odd to us that stars would be aligned so perfectly like that, and while we were watching, the middle and upper light started flashing.  The light on top was flashing green and the middle light flashed red.  This continued for approximately one minute, then suddenly a fourth white light zoomed in from the East and into position directly over the green light, and a second or two later the lowest light took off in the opposite direction.Following that, the red and green lights turned white again.  Then one by one, the three remaining lights appeared to be moving away into the opposite direction of where we were.  First, the uppermost light became fainter and fainter, then the middle light and finally the lowest light remained, becoming fainter, and then disappeared.  The entire event probably lasted 30 minutes, though the initial alignment that we saw may have been like that for awhile.(My cell phone battery was dead, or I would&apos;ve taken video of this!)",

The object slowly entered into the cloud at a slow speed and was covered up.I stood for a while longer looking all around this cloud waiting for it to exit, as I headed back to my job slowly, and with my eyes on the cloud...absolutely nothing came out of the cloud.I have thought of all other possibilities as to what it could have been..... The only things that are most outstanding is that it was very long for its thickness and with no contours to the body.  The other outstanding thing is that it did not have wings.There was a dark outline around the object, and with a (best description) white/shiny interior, the end were exactly the same (rounded), and there was no glare off the object from the sun in the West.I cant get this out of my mind....its time I report this!  The clouds were not that high up, a large plane at that height and speed would be too slow for long distance travel, and not to mention the shape would be of a plane clearly!  When I think of the cloud bank and the length of the object, the object could easily have covered at least 3 quarters of the clouds thickness (bank)!

But then I noticed it wasn&apos;t really moving. It was hard to determine if it was in our atmosphere or in space.  Then I began to think perhaps it was a very bright star or planet, but it just seemed too big for that and the red hue didn&apos;t make sense.  I couldn&apos;t really determine what it might be. I called to my wife and a visting friend who witnessed it as well. Star, plant, plane; they came to the same conclusion as me.  I called a neighbor and he and his family witnessed it as well. They had a pair of binoculars and ! indicated that it was round with a red hue.  They could not determine if it was in our atmosphere or not.  We watched it for about 15-20 minutes, and then it made an apparent wobble to the left and the white light disappeared.  You could then see a faint red twinkling hue in it&apos;s place.

Initially I dismissed the objects as airplanes as Switzerland lying at the crossroads of Europe sees lots of air traffic.  My initial assessment was deemed incorrect on the basis of other aircraft moving across the sky at altitudes that made it clear that they were indeed aircraft (shape, contrails, speed of movement).  The four objects remained almost motionless, until I witnessed a smaller and less bright object break or drop away from one of the objects.  At this point (after five minutes of viewing) I determined it necessary to gather other witnesses.  I went into my house and asked my girlfriend to come outside with me, and to bring a camera.  When we returned outside, the 4 objects were now 3 and we watched them for approximately 10 more minutes before going inside to look for another camera with! a telephoto lens.  The objects moved slowly, and were hard to see against the brightness of the clear summer sky, often fading into the blue back ground and then returning with intensity in a new location making it difficult to judge their exact location.

They both were intertwining with each other in a circular fashion, then they would move apart a little, then intertwine again as they moved south west.  After a few seconds of watching,  One object dimmed and then turned silver, and then disappeared.  The other object went very fast to the west for a second then almost stopped and then just drifted off to the west, it did disappear at one point then reappeared. I then lost sight of it.

It is a very small airport that does not handle large aircraft or carrier lines.At roughly 9:45pm CST my wife and I were in our front yard.  We were walking past the front of our house passing south when we saw two odd shapes in the sky, quickly followed by one, then another.My best description is that all four shapes were identical, and looked like fireballs, each of which cast a tail of radiation in its wake that made each object look vaguely like a glove with the fireball at the palm and the fingers (four or five) trailing in the wake (my wife saw something very similar, but not in as much detail).  They were orange-yellow, about the shade of fire you&apos;d see from a campfire.I have no way of gauging their size nor distance from the earth&apos;s surface, except to say that 5 or 6 of them grouped together would have been enough to blot out the moon from our view.We initially saw one of the shapes moving directly overhead, due south.  Then another shape seemed to appear directly overhead (or simply fly into our field of vision), then another.  At around the same time we observed the third shape overhead, we realized there was another such shape further off in the southern sky.All four shapes continued rapidly due south until they disappeared from our sight.  They did not disappear over a horizon, nor were they obstructed by trees or buildings, but rather they seemed to fly straight off into the sky until they became too small to see.We initially thought they may be skydivers, but couldn&apos;t explain the intense fire.  We also thought they might be hot air balloons, but we both concluded they were moving fast enough that we couldn&apos;t hope to catch them in our truck, even if we drove rapidly in a straight line after them.  We heard no sound from them whatsoever.",
20100821,20100826," Washington (near), PA", unknown,45 seconds,"Large white craft seen on 1-70W during morning trafficOn Saturday, August 21, 2010, I was driving to Wheeling, WV to attend a wedding.  At around 10:45AM, while approaching Washington, PA on I-70W, a large object in the northern sky caught my attention.  Since there was a bit of traffic and I was driving relatively slowly, I was able to observe the object for approximately 45 seconds. The first instant I saw it, I thought it must have been a very large, low flying jet of some sort, but further observation ruled that out.  The object was long, thin, tapered at each end, with a somewhat thicker section in the middle of the craft. It was a solid white in color and was flying at about 8 inches (visually) above the treeline.  It was at least five inches long at arm&apos;s length from end to end, and maybe about an inch maximum from top to bottom at the thickest part. Again, it appeared to be very large.  I could see that it was definitely gliding toward my general direction at a steady speed.  I could not distinguish the exact! shape of the craft as I was looking at an approaching object dead-on. In my opinion, it was probably a large disk or chevron-shaped craft.  There was no sound and I saw no contrail. It was very startling due to the size and nature of the object.  It was unlike anything I am familiar with seeing in the sky.  I was unable to see where it went after I drove past it.I know for a fact that several other people had the chance to see this object, as there were many vehicles on the road at the time, the object was quite noticeable, and traffic was moving relatively slowly.  I&apos;m extremely curious to see if another witness might read this report and come forward with their own account.  Perhaps someone at a different vantage point was able to get a better view of the shape of the object.",

Practically looked like it would come out of the white object, do a little peek show, and then disappear and this carried on for an hour.As time went on, the white light was slowly but gradually moving north/northeast-ward.  I was holding my Camcorder thinking to myself, &quot;I have to get this on film&quot;.  I recorded everything I saw and had experienced.

They were both a light shade of a green color with a white tint to them.  When my parents had joined me again, they saw the last end of it, which was, it shot behind the tower it was next to.

It probably only took me 30 or 40 seconds to take the first 5 or 6 photos because the rocks were hurting my feet and I wanted to get down to the pool deck where I took about two more.  I showed my wife and she thought I might have had something on the lens. If I did it came off quick because the last four photos do not show the object.  I zoomed in on ! the photos to see if I could detect a shape. Two looked oval and the other two appeared to have a saucer shape.

Ive checked star maps and i can see nothign indicating a star or planet anywhere near this brightness in the sky in that direction. Its really creeping me out!   Before a month ago ive never seen it before and ive lived here for my whole life, and after the first sighting, it dissapeared for a full week (i scanned the sky every night for hours) and re appeared exactly one week later at almost the exact same time and has been out almost every day since, with the exception of it dissapearing a couple times and re appearing later.((NUFORC Note:  Jupiter sighting.

20100824,20100826," Nashville, TN", circle,30 minutes (+or-),"Silent White Orb UFO followed by other Unidentified CraftAugust 24, 2010 On August 24, 2010 around 8 pm or so, my girlfriend and I were relaxing outside our apartment in West Nashville, TN.  The sky was clear, with a full moon illuminating the sky considerably.While looking at the moon we witnessed a very bright, solid white, orb-like object float into our field of view.  We don&rsquo;t know where it originated from as it seemed to have simply appeared.As we watched the light, we witnessed it accelerate fluidly and slow down just the same.  The object was able to make left, right, up, and down movements while changing altitudes quickly.  This object was totally silent, and it traversed the length of our house, but must have been at least a couple of miles away.  The light then moved behind the trees just behind our house.  Yet, being as bright as it was, we were still able to maintain visual contact and track its movement.  We were at this point standing on my neighbor&rsquo;s porch, my girlfriend on my right, when the object vanished.  Simultaneously, a shooting white light shot off into space faster than lightening.  The light trail was almost imperceptible to the eye, and it&rsquo;s duration a fraction of a second.  Almost like a reverse shooting star.At this point, we were stunned because we knew it was like nothing we had ever seen.  As we sat and discussed the object/light, we continued watching the sky. It couldn&rsquo;t have been mo re than 5 or ten minutes since the other object vanished when we began to see multiple high-altitude aircraft flying towards the area where the object had been.  These aircraft made no sound, and had blue and red quick flashing/blinking lights.  These lights flashed quickly and they appeared to be set in a rectangular shape or pattern.  One after another, these aircraft continued to appear at what looked like the same altitude and speed; the latter being hard to estimate.  At one point, it appeared these craft were assuming a triangular formation or were flying in a formation directly above where we witnessed the first object.I estimate seeing at least 10 of these aircraft, and I do not believe these were commercial aircraft.  I think it&rsquo;s possible they were military in nature, and that they also may have been circling the area.  These aircraft eventually disappeared, maintaining the same direction, speed, and altitude.",

I was looking out the window in a north east direction and contemplating taking my telescope out to view the night sky as the moon was very bright in the eastern sky low above the trees. I was looking at the constellation Cassiopeia when there was a bright star that began to descend from the constellation. As it descend it got brighter and very large then began to move in a north eastern direction rapidly.  The total experience was less than 1 minute.Background: I often lay on my couch watching television and look out a 6&rsquo;wide by 10&rsquo; high sliding glass patio doorway.  When looking out the sliding glass doors I am facing in a north eastern direction.  My wife and I live somewhat near the O&rsquo;Hare Airport and are in the direct line of incoming and outgoing air traffic.  So, I am very familiar with aircraft and their appearance both in daylight and dark night skies.  I have seen aircraft flying low and high and feel I can tell the difference between aircraft and what I saw on 8/26/2010 at 9:03pm.9:03pm 8/26/2010: I had spent the evening noticing how the sky was clear and how the moon was very bright and low in the eastern sky. At approximately 8:50pm CST I noticed a bright star below the moon and wondered if it was a planet.  I took a walk back into a spare room where I keep my 10&rdquo; Orion Dobsonian Telescope. But as it was going to be too much trouble to take it out of the storage closet I decided against it.  I walked back to the living room and lay upon the couch and was looking at the constellation Cassiopeia and noticed that from out of view above the sliding glass door a star was getting brighter and looked as though it was descending directly from the constellation. Over the next few second the star got very large, bright white and began to slow its descent. At this point I called for my wife in our bedroom reading a book to please look out the window, as the bedroom window are on the same north eastern facing wall.  She said she could not see a thing, as I assumed she had alrea! dy closed the drapes as she always does. As this conversation was happening the object had gotten very large and stopped descending. It was at a magnitude I have never witnessed before.  My wife did come out of the room and asked what I wanted her to see, as my request was unusual and I was shocked at what was happening and I think she could hear that in my voice.  I continued to observe the object and it got suddenly got very bright and moved in a north easterly direction rapidly.   When she joined me at the sliding glass door, I pointed out the object and she said &ldquo;you mean that star&rdquo;.  When my wife said &ldquo;you mean that star&rdquo;, the object had already become about an 15th of its largest size and had moved out and away from us. It moved rapidly and then disappeared into the sky in that same direction.  She said it probably was plane, but she had not witnessed the full event.Conclusion: In the two years I have been living here and observing the night sky and passage of commercial planes I have never witnessed anything like this before.  The object I saw was round and moved like nothing I had ever seen before.  It descended rapidly from what appeared to be a small star to a large round object. It hovered for a second before rapidly moving out of sight.  There were no blinking lights on the object like on the commercial craft that fly overhead constantly.  And as this was a clear night I am an amateur astronomer I cannot identify what it was that I witnessed. My only conclusion would be to say that this was an UFO.",

When looking through binoculars it is rounded in shape, and pulsates different colours, it appears to take on different shapes such as circular, and oval, and within the shape there are lines running through it glowing different colours.  Bright white is the predominate colour with red, blue, and green. It flies in no set pattern, it will hover then move diagonally hover again and then move vertically. It will also move in a circular pattern.  The object rests for no longer than 30 seconds and will move in an unpredictable flight pattern.

I had been looking at the stars, particularly the big dipper, before I fell asleep and happened to look at it again above the minivan.  A large light, larger than the stars which compose the big dipper, but appeared almost as distant, streamed through the constellation at a very high rate of speed.  I thought it might have been a shooting star, but it wasn&apos;t moving fast enough.  Once it reached a spot below the big dipper the light dimmed slightly, and then moved back and forth (left and right) in its descent, almost playfully, before taking a straight course again and I eventually lost it over what I believe was Canada.  It was heading a due north course.  The color was white, the shape was round, and the object moved and dimmed. This was not a plane.

Also they didn&apos;t appear to flash uniformily like a light bulb would.  It looked more like the flickering of fire. After a while the lights started to flicker out.  But my husband then pointed to where one of them was and we saw that we could still see something moving against the sky, it was just completely darkened.  At that point there was a commercial jet in the sky and they were moving about twice the speed of the jet. But before, while they were lit up, they were moving much slower.All three of us are college educated, upper middle class.  My sister is 25. I am 29, and my husband is 34.",

Everyone, 6 members, also saw the lights floating in the sky.The fireballs were originally floating at different levels and intervals, then continued floating in a semi-circle formation to the south east where after about 5 minutes of witnessing this, they just simply flickered out of sight.The sky was clear with no visible clouds.

It was brighter and larger than anything else in the sky.The light would glow bright and produce a huge halo around itself, then it would dim, in a very slow pulse. The light, when glowing bright, formed elongated spikes of light above and below the main part of the light. I got my binoculars to observe the light closer. With the binoculars, I could see in the center of the light three colored orbs: red, blue, green, positioned in a triangle to each other. In succession, each orb would glow bright, then dim (not flashing).I observed the light until the dawn made it impossible. During the entire time I watched the light it did not move its location in the sky; neither vertical nor horizontal.I attempted to observe the light the next morning at the exact same time and place but it was no longer there.((NUFORC Note:  Sirius is to the left of, and below, Orion.

They were absolutely silent and moved slightly sporadically.  The disks were spinning, but not on a perfect axis.  They were not in sync, but they stayed relatively close to one another for the approximate two minutes in which I observed them. It seemed as though they were moving closer and they flew higher extremely fast.   From my perspective, it seemed as if they flew straight up into the sky. I was able to keep an eye on the objects the whole time until I had to travel below an overpass and I lost sight of the objects, which were very far away the last time I had my eye on them. I was a passenger in a car with two other people, who both observed the objects.  Traffic notably slowed down on the exit ramp, as I assume that other drivers noticed them as well. When the car I was in parked at the mall, I got out and saw an unmarked plane, and I am! not sure if it had any relation to the UFO sighting I had witnessed minutes before.   The sighting did not have any physical effects on me or on any of the other passengers in the car that I was traveling in.  As one who takes particular interest in UFOs I was absolutely speechless to observe the sighting, and it has left a traumatizing mental effect, as the images I saw have been in my head the whole day.

I then looked around to see if others had seen the object, and noticed that several other patrons were already staring skyward.  We began to ask each other if we were seeing the same thing, and if we had any idea what it was.My initial reaction was that I was seeing some sort of balloon suspended in the sky with a light shining on it.  However, I quickly realized that the light was being emitted from the object itself.  I felt very strange as I stared upwards in disbelief along with several others.  The orange orb appeared to be changing its shape.  Its movements during this time are hard to describe, but seemed to be pulsing.The nightclub featured many patrons with glow sticks and other flashing lights.  A DJ was playing electronic music from the roof terrace.  I began pointing at the object with two glow sticks to help others see what I was talking about.  At this time, it began to pull back further up into the sky.  The light became dimmer and it moved near what appeared to be a star in the sky, slightly to the west at about 60 degrees above the horizon.Over approximately the next twenty to thirty minutes, the orange glowing orb would generally move in a methodical fashion between several stars / planets in the night sky.  Sometimes it would move slowly and deliberately, while other times it would move in quick movements.  On one occasion, while pointing the light out to another individual, we watched as it slowly approached a star, and then made a semi-circle movement around the star, and then proceed in a straight line.  Based on my own amateur use of a night sky computer program, I believe that this star may have been Altair.I tried to take a picture of the object with my phone&apos;s camera. The object did not appear on the camera, however, an unexplained square orange shape appeared on one image, which I would be happy to provide if needed.  I did not see any square shapes with the naked eye.At least 15 to 20 patrons witnessed the same event over the course of approximately 20 to 30 minutes.

The lights came in formation from the east starting as 1 bright light at approximately 700-800ft followed by 4 bright lights, followed by 3 bright lights, then followed by 4 bright lights,then 3 bright lights, and then lastly by 1 bright light. This formation passed directly overhead and as i! t passed directly overhead the lights went out in intensity like a candle would go out, until the lights disappeared.
